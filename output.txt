{"\" Alright, what is going on? People of the internet welcome back to another episode of the Waveform podcast. We're your host, I'm Marquez. I'm Andrew. And I'm David. This week we've got a whole bunch of variety of stuff to talk about. We're going to talk about Twitter one last time because they're changing their name. I guess we'll still refer to it as Twitter this time. Even though there's still references of Twitter all over it still. I want to refer to it as Twitter for the rest of time. I probably will still keep doing that until it's gone. We're also going to talk about some tech that we've been enjoying lately. And I want to talk about a little bit of a topic that Linus actually made a video about and sort of expand on it. And I think that's actually where I'm going to start. I'm going to start with everyone should watch Linus's one of his recent new videos, which was about, let me look up the exact title because it was pretty, I think it was called, base models are a lie or something. Yeah, like the biggest lie in tech or something like that. Let me find the exact, okay. Starting at is the biggest lie in tech. So like, yeah, base models, you think of like the starting at $200, but there's also much higher specs available. That type of thing is the biggest lie in tech. I went into it thinking he was going to talk about certain things. And he talked about mostly computers. And I think that's what the focus was. The thumbnail was him holding a laptop. But I wanted to like expand on that a little more because I feel like there's, when I watched that video, I just thought like, oh, that's different. Product categories. So in computers, which is what his video is about, he is 100% right. Like the base product, the base product is usually bad. And the starting at price is basically just advertising. Yeah. No one actually buys anything at that starting price. Most people are late. Yeah. I was late. Yeah. They are really early. The Celeron Pixel Slate. We reviewed it. They took it off the market because it was so bad. It's like the sacrificial product that lets them have better advertising. Which is weird because it's usually the worst version of the product. Yeah. But it's not like, usually it's not pixel slate bad. Usually it's just decent enough to qualify. But then the upper the better specs, it's usually really good. In the computer world, it's more obvious than ever. Because like say, take a laptop, for example. You have a laptop that says starting at $5.99. But it'll have only four gigs of RAM and only 128 gigs of storage. And it's like, well, obviously I'm going to be upgrading those things. I don't think you should buy a laptop these days with only those things. And then laptops these days are less upgradable than ever before. Especially if you focus on Apple IK did, you get a laptop that is basically stuck at its exact spec, no upgradable storage, no upgradable RAM forever. So you really are definitely not getting the base spec. So the starting at price kind of feels like a lie because you're never really getting that. But then I thought about other product categories. And the other two that came to my mind, maybe there's others that came to your mind when hearing about this, is smartphones and cars. In cars, it is a complete lie. Yeah. Basically, unless you're going direct to consumer, you basically can't get a base price car. They'll always have the commercial that says, well equipped, starting at $2,999. But the $2,999 is not a real car that you can get. Is well equipped different than starting at? Yeah, that is a little different. But starting at $20, I mean, that's their version of WellClip. That's a different way to like slide you in there. I guess probably because base model is impossible to get there, like, you know, maybe we should stop saying this. Even base model, if you get like, whatever, like a RAV4 at base, a lot of times in different places, they'll have all these packages that are on top of the car. And you're like, oh, I don't want that. It's on the car already. I don't know what you want to do. All weather package. Yeah. And also like a lot of the base versions are missing like many things you would obviously want in a car. I was going to see that say that sounds kind of like a slight to say, well equipped at this price. It's like our base model sucks. I don't know what they're saying. Our base model is not well equipped. Yeah, they can say that. They can say that. Doesn't have to eat it anything. But you can say that when you can never buy the base model. It's they can be like, yeah, those ones you don't want to buy. Also, they're not available in our parking lot, right now. Yeah. So you don't get it. Yeah, it's all about which ones they can sell off the lot. And they're trying to sell things with higher margins. And they don't really want to sell the cheapest possible version, which is often not a good product. Anyway, but then in smartphones though, in smartphones, I think most, a lot of people actually do by the base model. And that's fine because most people weren't thinking they're going to upgrade their phone at any point down the line. So getting whatever, the 128 gig version, if they need some storage, they can pay for that. But a lot of people are cool with 128 gig base model of whatever phone they just bought. And that's totally fine too. So I think that's actually it's different in different parts of tech. There is. I feel like I can almost make the argument that in smartphones, it almost changes a little bit though, because the one of the first things I did think of was the POCO phone. And I feel like when you're getting into these cheaper budget phones, they are kind of doing this weird thing of like, we've seen Xiaomi a couple times do the like, this is the $79 phone that only 200 of you can get. And then it turns into 250, which is. That's almost worse. It's worse. Yeah, but it is different. And like the POCO phone, when it first came out, the it was like, this is the $300 phone, but 99% of people are viewing it, reviewed that like $450 version. That was cooler, which is just like, so I have notes on other versions of this. Yeah, that's one of them where it's like, we, most people will hear that this phone starts at $299, but every single person reviewing it is reviewing a more expensive version of it. That's one thing that happened with the POCO phone that usually happens with computers. They don't ship the base version to reviewers. And then the other version is when you see the lineup on the website of like, all the different specs it's capable of. I think like take a Razer laptop, for example, that you can get like a 120Hz display or 4K display. And then it's capable of like, up to 12 hours of battery if you have the worst display. They will list up to 4K display and up to 12 hours battery. Next to each other, as if you can get a machine with both those things, but that doesn't exist. Totally. That's another thing that happens all the time that drives me crazy. Yeah. So as a reviewer, I try to say how much the thing I'm reviewing costs and sort of evaluate different pricing tiers. And should you get the base version? Should you get the version I reviewed somewhere in between? Here's what you should upgrade. But yeah, those two things drive me crazy. Yeah, I want to step back on the laptop or computer versus smartphone thing again. I had a wild story with my sister. And I think I told you guys this, when the M1 or possibly M2 Mac Mini was out, or I guess M1, there was like this deal where you could get the second storage tier, the 256GB option, which also came with a little bit more RAM, I think, for like $50 more. And that deal came out two days after my sister bought the base model. And so I was like, I'd message her and I said, if you can, you should return yours and get this for $50 more. And she was like, why? And I was like, I think you're going to have this spec forever. It's twice the storage. And she was like, what do I need storage for? And I was like, wow, there's so many people that I think it's hard for us to see outside of this because I cannot imagine having a laptop of 128 gigs of storage. We like make videos that it's like two terabytes for a project. I'm like importing footage right now. But that was a laptop, right? No, that was the Mac mini. Okay, sorry. So it depends on what you're going to, what people are going to do like that with that computer. Right. So the 128 gig version exists. And theoretically, there's a non-zero number of people who are totally fine with that. I think there's a lot of people that are totally fine with that. Yeah. Like if you look at the iMac, like the on one iMac, I would bet you that most people bought the absolute base model. That's why they didn't upgrade from M1 to M2. Yeah. I think when you look at what Apple sells in the stores too, like if you go to Apple.com and go to like a pickup and you expect something out, especially like a custom computer with certain RAM and certain storage, you'll always see a longer lead time for anything that's not the base model. But if you spec a base model, it's like, yeah, we got these in the stores. In the store. In the office of the car, right? Yeah, it's exactly the way. Yeah, yeah. I think it's also that that would be my argument for why higher end smartphones make sense to buy base models because like most of us have cloud storage and stuff like that. We're not storing a million things on our phones. So like, yeah. 64 still feels kind of low, but I think a lot of base models now come with 120. Yes. And like that's totally reasonable for a phone. And a lot of times phones, you're not cheap. Obviously there's some outliers, but you're mostly just upgrading the storage for like a non-base model. That's the pretty much. That's totally fine. Like a base model is a great, they're great price for a lot of people. Yeah, it's interesting. You don't really see phones where you're just like, well, this model is 60 hertz. And if you get more storage, you also get 120 hertz. You have to go to the pro. Okay, that's interesting because it's different phrasing. It's kind of the same thing. Like if you just want to buy the iPhone, the base model is just the iPhone 14. And then you can buy the 120 hertz model, but that comes with more storage and different materials and stuff. And a different name. But it is kind of like the base model. But then it's like a different size and you have different camera phones. Right. It comes with an extra camera. It comes with a bigger higher refresh rate screen. Those I would say most of the companies are usually pretty good at differentiating that, but when you come to carriers in the US, I was going to say it before with like Samsung. I hope you like get the S23 starting at. And it's the like regular S23 price. But when you're looking at that, like that guy's probably going to sell you on like the S23 ultra. That now is at least the plus 700 more dollars. When you think about it, that's really smart from Apple to make the regular iPhone 14, the exact same size as the 14 pro. Because then sure you're getting a worse screen. But like every other company, if you get the pro, the screens bigger. And that like sucks for a lot of people that don't want massive phones. ROG phone. What about? There's a couple ROG phones, they're all the same size, but the pro is like a nice one. Well, that phone is probably the most computer-like phone. Yeah, a Jason. It's like a laptop, a Jason. Yeah, where when you upgrade the specs, you actually do get an overclock CPU and extra RAM, extra RAM, which you know, but he really cares about in phones anymore. You don't need 24 gigs of RAM on your phone. Yeah, that seems like something everyone should have. But it is actually pretty wild that people don't really need 128 gigs of storage on their phones. Yeah, I don't think so. I know how much storage you're using your phone right now. I could, well, I just started using the Pixel 12. I could look at my iPhone. I checked recently. I'm at like 212 gigs on my iPhone, so I could not do the base. 212? Yeah, I could not do the 128. And you don't think you could make room. If I didn't, so when I fly, I listen to music and it's all offline downloaded already. So if I blasted my whole Spotify library, I could probably get under 128, but I don't want to. I'm currently using 158 gigs, so you couldn't use the 128. Yeah, I mean, if you really wanted to delete a ton of stuff, but that's, that's no sacrifice. I would get the second, but honestly, yeah, it's because I download a ton of YouTube videos. I'm looking at the biggest storage things. I have 36 gigs of YouTube videos downloaded. Jesus. That's, that's, that's easy to claim. I know that's so easy to claim. It's easy to claim. I fly a lot and I download like 30 videos. I do. I download them on the runway and I like hold my phone up to the window and like download some YouTube videos. Yeah, you gotta just plan an hour more ahead and it's so much easier than to like, please download before this takes off. Yeah. Second is podcasts of 23 gigs. And then light room. Light room, I only have 12 gigs, which is surprising. I feel like most people have like their photos and videos are the most. I have huge files because I transfer full camera images to my phones. I usually edit photos on my phone because I know that that's exactly how people are going to see it. For sure. So yeah, I could do one. I have 113 gigs used. 41 or an app somehow. Don't take anyone for taking us. Yeah, but it is crazy. I could take this pretty easy. Remember the time when everyone had the 8 gigabyte iPhone and people were running into storage issues all the time. Like my mom would only ever upgrade her phone because she couldn't take any more pictures. I'm pretty sure that that's the number one way that people run out of storage. Because other than that, like unless you download a bunch of offline files, whether it's music or movies or whatever, that's going to be your biggest files. Like if you have an iPhone Pro and you just turn on pro res by accident and shoot a bunch of 4k pro res, like you're going to cruise through a couple hundred gigs. If you want to be really tin foil hat, you could just be like, well, they're making these super high resolution 100 megapixel sensors now on phones because the storage is way higher. And then you have to buy the higher tier or the better cloud storage. Yeah, they do a good job of like, binning it down. Like they're not actually good. I think another number's sell. And like you can buy the pixel has a 48 megapixel camera, but you literally can't shoot for the 8 megapixel images. Yeah, it would like all bins down. But yeah, they're trying to give us a good experience, I think at the end of the day. So ideally, you know, compression. It is, I just want to say one more time, I would never buy a computer with 128GB of storage. No, but talking to my sister, I'm realizing how many people would. That I also agree on. Yeah, I think you're totally right with like the iMac. I mean, think of like Chromebooks also. Yeah, a lot of people re-reasing, they buy Chromebooks is because they know all that they do is really look on the internet and do stuff. So like, why do you need storage to browse the internet and watch streaming? Okay, so a question for everyone. Is there a piece of tech that you think you could be totally fine living a lifetime with the base version of? Yes, it's called the iPhone 12 mini and I've been doing it for years. Do you have the base base model? Base base. 64GB? Is that 64GB? Oh, that's cutting it close. Are you close to the top of 64 enough? I was until I updated to the iOS 17 beta, right? Somehow wiped 20GB of system files off of my phone. If it works, it works. We wiped them off. Yeah, like before. Just make some space. I didn't find out. It's just the common importance stuff. I had been juggling my last six gigs for a year. You know what I mean? And things were starting to not work. Nothing involving my voice worked. Voice to text didn't work. Siri would never even load. Forget it. It just exploded the models that was like, I can't. There's no more storage. I guess so. But with the beta and all of my new space, she lives. I also, I just want to say, I was talking to Hiyato, but this is maybe unrelated, so maybe it won't make it. But I accidentally slammed a glass bottle down on the screen of this phone and the glass bottle broke. To be even just, the iPhone is so rammed. It's sealed. Did we just talk last episode about a bottle hitting your phone and then we're dending the bottle to the pixel. The pixel fold dented the metal. Yeah. Wow. Those are times. Fones can beat drinks pretty easy. I will say a ton of people by the base model air pods. Even the old air pods with the long stem, I see so many people that still have those. I actually see way more of those than AirPods Pro. Are they the base or the USB-C ones? They're not letting you USB-C ones, right? Or sorry, lightning. I meant, you're all f**king that up. Well, the old base ones were a headphone jack. That's where we're going. Wait, you mean that you're going to... Just cut all of this out. Cut all of this out. I don't know if I could consider AirPods base model because you can't upgrade it. Those are ear pods, I thought. No, AirPods. What are the wireless AirPods? We're not talking about ear pods. I wouldn't say that's a base model, because you can't upgrade that version. You could just get a better... You're saying like the Gen 1? Like those AirPods and AirPods Pro. Yeah. And AirPods are one thing, the base model and then the... You can upgrade to noise cancellation. And now you have a different... But they're also a different shape, but it's a totally different product. But you could make that same argument for like... Regular phone versus a pro phone. All interesting. How many parts of the boat do I have to take off to make it? Yeah, but the boat... Well, no, I think the pro phone... There's still a base model of a pro phone. I think that... Well, but it's not the pro phone. The other two different models. For what? Yeah. So do you think... The iPhone example, where you have the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 plus, iPhone 14 pro, and iPhone 14 pro max. All of them have a base model. Okay. That's true. Okay. You're right. That's true. That's right. But I think also when you walk in the store, a lot of people go, what's the new iPhone? Yeah. And they end up with the base model. I feel like you mentioned that before as like the step out of the base model. I was like the thinking of it as a bigger picture. But I would still consider, I think most of our listeners would consider each of those having a base model. It's just storage. I think the same thing happens with AirPods. Like people walk into the store and they just say, I want AirPods and they buy the cheapest AirPods. I agree. Yeah. It's... Maybe not technically right, but I think that's how people think about it. And people do that, yeah? We're getting into semantics. It sounds great. I know people listen to this podcast, or like that sound them saying, what do you mean you just walk in and say iPhone? But when you buy the store and listen, you're like, oh my god, they're just asking for the iPhone. Yeah. And they have nothing else to say. Yeah. It's crazy. Uh-huh. It's crazy sometimes. Yeah. So is that the base model, Adam? Yeah. What's your phone? I live on base models all the time because cloud storage is a thing. 128. Less than that I've done in the past. 32. No. I also got to say something that hurts is when you're trading in phones, less and less they ask for the storage that you're training in. So it's like, Really? On Apple at least does not ask for the storage tier. So you get the same amount for a 512 gigabyte iPhone 14 pro than you'll get for it. Well, here's the dirty little secret. It doesn't cost them a lot to add more memory. They can charge you by the charge. This was the crux of Linus' video. Oh really? In case you haven't watched it, I mean, you should watch this video. It's really good. And it's a learning experience. But that's the number one thing that he talks about in his video is the amount that someone like Apple charges for eight more gigs of built-in storage versus the amount of extra cost there is to Apple is it's like a 300% plus markup every time. I will say that's very different than it used to be because I remember buying my first iPod and it was like the option between like eight and 16 gigabytes of storage. And back then storage was really expensive. They still upsold you on it. But it wasn't like today where like like memory is the cheapest possible component. Yeah. I just think it has definitely stratified over time. I remember speccing my computer back in the day when I built my HP Pavilion DV7T on HP's website. Old. Yeah. I know. But it was like going from. For RIMs. So when you went from four to eight gigs of RAM, you went from 32 to 64 bit Windows. And I remember looking at that and then looking at other computers like that you could buy and how much they charge for next four gigs of RAM. And it was very consistent across the board. And now it's like, if you go to Apple, it's literally like $200 more dollars to bump up your RAM. That's watch line says video, but that's the main point of it. Storage is the highest margin thing. Do you guys have any base model things that you can live with? Yeah. I think I would be able to live with a base model Ruby and R1T. If given the check, that's not the base. I think I could live with the base one. The dual, even the new dual motor one. Whatever the cheapest model. The base model is just a gas truck. That I have a whole lot of. The R1T now has, they're now shipping the dual motor version. So there's the quad motor launch edition and then there's the base model. But those, I think when you look at like Rivian and even Tesla, there's so few specs that they're kind of all very similar to the base model. The base model, baby. Base model is great. I'd be fine with one. Yeah. That's fair. That's fair. I would say my car, I could do the base version. Of the flat. Of the flat. Oh yeah. The long range model S. Long range model S is a base version. That's true. Yeah. Oh yeah. The fact that it's long range. Do you get a wheeler, you know? You get a yoke still. Oh yeah. You can option a wheeler, I believe. Or might be bad. In my case, I think it's a wheel now and you can option. Sounds like the base model is better. Well, that's the question. Is that I guess that question becomes is the model S the base model or is the model three the base model? Yeah. I think the model S is different from the model. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. All of the base models are fine. Yeah, the model has a really bad base model. Model S is the model 3 pro. Imagine if they called it that. That's the person who just walks in and goes, I would like a Tesla. Which one? So the model Y is the model 3 plus. Yes. And the S is the model 3 pro. It's got more storage. And the X is the pro max. It all works. That's true. It all works out. It's perfect. Yeah. I would like a car please. Here you go. Yeah, here's the model 3. It's hard for me to figure that out. I'll have to do more thinking on that. Because my entire life basically has been very much like if I cannot afford the version of it I want, I will just wait. Like I'm not I'm not bad about needing to save up more money to eventually buy the buy things though. I also do not buy this almost ever. I guess that's another question for you spends to like what upgrade isn't like what are you just okay with on it. It just doesn't matter to you. Not that you're saving money. It's just because you don't care about generally like clothes. Well, it's just I didn't mean in general. I'm not thinking like in tech is there an unnecessary upgrade that you make anyway? Like you don't care about like you're not going to spend money because I get what you mean by you want to spend money for the thing you want. But is there something you're not going to also spend an extra $200 to upgrade something if you don't care about that. Right. So is there something which I'm sure you'd have to think about for it? I have to think about it. Pretty much every upgrade we make is because we really want it. Yeah. And like we're spending extra money to get it. I think that's a good thing to live by also. Like if you want something that's expensive and you really want something that right then you can't afford it's way better to just wait and save up for it because then when you buy the cheaper version you're just going to be sad with the thing you spend a ton of money on and then that's something. That's a lesson I learned from my mom when I was like nine because I wanted a toy and I bought the cheap version and it broke within like a week. And she was like see how do you just wait? Do you have the two weeks of allowance? You deserved it. You kid Adam deserved that. Let me tell you how I have trauma. Let me tell a really quick existential story. Okay. Existing. Yeah. When I was in fourth and fifth grade we had every week we would get points at the end of the week if we didn't like get in trouble right and have our card moved or whatever. Classic fifth grade. And on Friday afternoons we'd watch a movie and you could either spend some of your points. I think we get a hundred points a week and it was like 50 points for a candy so you could buy two candies or you could only spend half of them or you could spend none of them. And at the end of the year we had an auction where everyone had to bring in something from like the thrift store or something and we would like have an auction to teach kids how auctions worked. But fourth and fifth grade we had the same teacher so you could keep your points over into the next year if you wanted. Dude I'd be saving this. This is like good life lesson. 34th grade. 34th grade at the end of fifth grade. Like what am I getting? I'm just imagining I'm just imagining I'm just imagining for a Tesla. Yeah. I'm imagining fourth graders at a thrift shop buying things for. No so literally I didn't spend a single point for two years because I was like I'm going to go to that last auction I'm going to get whatever the crap I want. Yes. That's me. So that's what I did. But, it's about school. It, I ended up buying like a pda that I didn't use and then I get away. It's the most David answer. Of course we did. Yes. Yes. But the interesting life lesson in that is that I did have to think about like huh. It is worth like having small amounts of happiness throughout your life right? Like maybe I should have gotten some candy every now and then because I felt extremely powerful going into that last auction but I felt really empty when I bought the pda. Yeah the pda tasted disgusting. I have a theory. This is a theory. I love that story because it reminds me of I have a theory that there are basically two types of like video game players. If you're playing a first person game you know you can kind of like go through the game and upgrade little bits as you get more vc or whatever you like. Oh I got enough for the thing. I'll buy something. Oh I got enough for something new. I'll buy something every single time and then there's the other person who's like I'm going to get as far into this game as I possibly can without upgrading a single thing. How I'm going to go to the absolute limit of this character then I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to dominate and I'm going to buy a ton of stuff and I'm going to crush this level and I'm going to go 40 more levels with this exact setup. Right. Grind super early. That is my setup. There's this roll through the game. The other version of that is like do you play the game straight through the story mode and do all the bosses at like the lowest level of XP or do you do every single side quest so you just walk up to the last boss and f***ing like one shot in second. Yeah. Because you have so much like so many stuff. I like saving it. I get I get some value out of like saving it. So like if I can save two more weeks of allowance and get Aegee's ram on the laptop, I'm doing it. Yeah. There was a time in Pokemon Gold where I upgrade or I evolved my Sintaquil into a Typhlosion before I even left the first town. So I just rolled up to the gym leader who had a level six. A Gen 1 only. What? Gold is amazing. I knew it was amazing. Best game. I had a level 36 Pokemon and destroyed the gym leader's level six Pokemon. It's really fun. In NBA 2K there's a storyline. It's probably similar to Pokemon but literally you go through college basketball and then you go through early overseas pro leagues trying to get scouted and you try to get as far as you can without upgrading any of your skills and you're just a bum on the court and you can barely score but you're barely holding on and then you get to a cutscene where it's like sorry, son, you're not good enough to start. Oh my god. Wow, I need to get better. Then you go to the store and you buy all the skills and you max everything out and you come back and you just are a god on the court. But it's so fun. I always feel like it's going to feel better than it does. Like when I destroyed that level six Pokemon with my level 36 Typhlosion, I was expecting it to feel amazing and I was just like, this feels kind of empty. I can look them on these better. I can tell you why the other side sucks. Strength animation. In Pokemon, I use my master ball immediately. What? And then when I had to catch me too, I was in total panic forever because I was a kid and I was a moron and I was like at my friends, I was almost crying because I didn't think I was going to get into. Do you remember what you used the master ball on? No. Probably not. Probably like a better free or something. It was probably something stupid, like a cipher or something like that or it was that. This is what I feel like when you guys talking about sports. Just don't know what a master ball is. Yeah, use my master ball on Wayne Gretzky just like to make sure neither of you understand this conversation. Anyway, we're pretty off the rail. Yeah, I think it's probably time for you to have a free. Anyway, take the base model as far as you can and then spend what you think it's worth. Use your master ball on the first level. Trivia time. All right, so according to motor one, what was the best selling car of Q1 2023? Oh, I know the answer. I think I know the answer. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. In the US, in the world. In the world. I know the answer. World wide. There's an article about this. Yeah. I don't. I love this question. Me too. 20 club. I know it's not the fiat because apparently they only sold like 20 of them in the Q1 in the US or something like that. I want to get this one. They're just fiat. I'm going to give you the company. You're going to even hints. I think we can all get this right. I'll give you hints. You don't have to give me. We'll do it at the end. Of course. I'll just get it wrong. I'm fine. All right. All right. I do need to catch who you have the most fun time. No, David has the most fun time. I'll give you a hint. It runs on gasoline. What? Actually, that's a good one. Wait, really? No. No. Oh, OK. That's a key. That's a key. That's what I assume. That's a massive hint. It does it. It's the hint. Oh my gosh. OK. We'll be back after the break. Oh, we were still going. Kruger, fresh for everyone. All right. Welcome back. As we were on our little ad break there, a little appalensite or article actually just dropped. And David, it was on your feed. So why don't you reveal it to us the way you did literally 25 seconds ago? OK. I think it's interesting. Let's pretend we're on ad break. Yeah. Reenactment. You guys are talking about a car. Lincoln avigator. No, Lincoln pickup truck. Lincoln pickup truck. Same company. iOS 17 code, hands-in action button. In iPhone 15 promo. That sounds still. Play a man. Action buttons are sick. Yeah. But it's also very unappable like I was immediately reminded of the remapable Google assistant physical buttons that we used to have on phones. OK. You can remap to other stuff. Yeah. There's only a few phones that have custom remapable buttons. There's only a few phones with extra buttons at all. Not at all. Sony has a shutter button, like a camera button. You can launch the camera and take pictures with the specific dedicated camera button. But there's a few phones. I want to say Asus has done it. A couple phones with an actionable, like a custom mapable extra button has done it a lot. Samsung's. Yeah. You can remap now, right? I think so. But I'm pretty sure you can. It was only Bixby for a while. It might only be to Google Assistant. I think it might be just to Google Assistant. There used to be like the Zenfone, I think six. It was seven. Yeah. They always used to have this just extra button you could do whatever you wanted with. Yeah. Which is sick. It's sick. It's very Android. Yeah. On an iPhone, what would that action button do? Because right now, the only thing I can think of, Apple Watch Ultra has the... What does it call? Action button. Is an action button? So you can kind of map a few different things. You can start a workout. You can open a certain workout with that button. What would an iPhone action button be able to do? I was worried. I was like, is this only going to be for exercise but on your phone? Like, that seems a little bit weirder. But in this article, it says that it might be able to do open accessibility, camera, flashlight, focus mode, magnifier, shortcuts, silent mode, translate or voice memos. Shortcuts seems dope. They're going to see the new features. Shortcuts would be awesome. If you could map it to a very specific short cut, that would be amazing. Siri Shortcuts is the best possible case. And even then, it kind of feels hacky. Because like, if I wanted to open a website, it would be like, all right, hold on. Let me launch Safari, type it in, refrat... It has to kind of go through a process. If Apple does this, I can imagine it being neutered and like, you can only do a certain set of eight things with it. And five of them are dumb. Like, change your focus mode with one button. Yeah. It's already like, it's so easy. Like, okay. The Muse Switch, by the way, on the iPhone, is like one of the smartest things they've kept around. Because not a lot of phones do that. One plus had the alert slider for a while, but like, just that quick like switch to mute. Yeah. It's so... That's been great. We love that. An action button I would want to be able to launch whatever app I want. Yeah. Let me just pick an app on my phone and launch it. Yeah. I don't think they're going to let us do that. Probably not. Which is a bummer. You could probably do that through shortcuts. Yeah. Yeah. Technically, yes. Yeah. And it would take like an extra second. Yeah, an extra second, but it would like the action button on the watch. You can map through shortcuts and have it do a bunch of things. Oh, really? Yeah. That's cool. So if they take that same thing and put it on the phone, I would imagine it would work similarly. I wish it didn't feel so hacky, but that is true. Yeah. It does eventually pull it off. It's... There is a lot of cool stuff, but yeah. Whenever I watch Quinn do things about shortcuts, it feels insanely hacky, but it's still kind of cool. This is cool, too. It says the action button may also take over the volume up buttons, duties in the camera app. It could activate the autofocus when lightly pressed, while a firm press will take a photo, far resembling conventional camera buttons, and a hard prolonged press will initiate video recording. I think they'll do that. That's dope. Because if you could just start recording a video instantly from your lock screen, that'd be really cool. I can't imagine the half press working. That sounds... It would have to be... It's probably a solid state button, which means it's like a half-dick button, sort of like the... Right. Which means... Would be experience phones have something like that? The Express Shutter button has a real half-shutter button. It has a half-shutter button. Yeah, you have a press for autofocus and then full press to take the shot. What is it autofocusing on that it's not all red? It has... It's acting like an alpha camera. So it has continuous autofocus. So it just hits what it moves something around, and you just want it to make sure that... It wants to do that. Because the sensor is so big that it actually has natural depth of field now. Yeah, it just feels like most phones like are autofocusing on something, and then you have to tap to pick something else. So how a half-spirited, too. So a half-touch of that doesn't necessarily pick what you want. It's picks what it wants, I guess. The Sony experiences, you can tap a certain autofocus point, and then autofocus with that point with the camera. It's just acting like an alpha camera, basically. So it's a little more advanced, it's cool. The iPhone... I suspect won't do all that, but it'll be cool to see an action button. Will they make it orange? This is a question. Yeah, that's a good question. I want it to be a certain color. I hope it's from the phone. I can't wait till it's just Siri. No, the power button's Siri. They can't do that to me. They can't do that. What if the power button powered the phone off? It does, but now you have to... I know, I know. Volume up. Exactly. Or volume down one at the end. God, it was just a Siri. It was a bad joke. It was a hard read. That would be the worst thing ever. They went back to power and then made that Siri. Unremappable Siri button. That would be awful. There was a major rumor that the buttons were all going to become solid state, and then that rumor went away. So maybe this is where that rumor started from. This could be an extra button that is solid state. So potentially it's all real buttons, but this is the first haptic button. Or like solid state button. And then they see how well it does, and they can judge how close they are to making all the buttons haptic. Yeah. Makes sense. You just let like 10 Apple leakers get a freebie off their wrong prediction that they got. Yeah, I mean, the rumor score is like 75% possible it says. So this could be totally wrong. Interesting. But, you know, we don't... We kind of rarely do rumors on here, but this one seems kind of fun and interesting. I'm into it. Yeah. I'm into special colored buttons on phones too. So I'm kind of hoping for that. I doubt that they're going to make it orange because the only reason that's orange is to be like a dive watch. True. Yeah. Make it red. Apple. Please. I think there's no shot. There's an accent color in zero. The brands are going to have a field day with this. Neon. Okay. Let's have a moment of silence for Twitter. And because it's no longer called Twitter technically. Technically. Depending on where you look. Depending on where on the site itself you are looking. It's been officially rebranded to x and it's x.com. And it's x is... And it's x videos, that's not true. It's just x related things. There's an x logo. The little bird is retired. Makes you wonder about all the people who bought the bird statues when they sold all that stuff. I wish I did. Yeah. Little birds that go. I don't know that I'm going to call it x. I'm still calling it Twitter. Like I think when I say it in public to a person. I'm still going to call it Twitter. I don't know how long it's going to take to catch on. Probably a long time. So you're saying you don't want to follow changing one of the most household brand names. In existence. In existence. It's got your to me every time a well known and at least decent reputation brand gets killed. H-B-I. Why? That's so just max. Like everyone knew that brand. Not that everyone used Twitter, but everyone knows what Twitter is. And to try to start that over, but with some sort of like, I mean, it's like meta. Like we all know what Facebook is and we're not calling it meta. But that product is called Facebook. Yeah, they at least did that. Yeah, it's a product. It's a product inside of a brand. It's like alphabet for Google, right? There's an umbrella company. And if they just made x the like parent company, which they did, they did make x corporate x warp, then they can keep the Twitter name. Then they can keep the Twitter name. Yeah, but they're just shafting it. I have two theories around this. Two possible theories. One, Elon is actually trying to do what he said is he's trying to do, which is basically to create the wechat of. Oh, he said that already. Yes, that's what he says, but he keeps me say, you know, I mean, that's what he's been saying forever, whether it. Yeah, he's talked about making the x app forever. When he was making PayPal, he tried to rebrand it to x and he got ousted. I think he likes to let her x. Yes. A little bit of it. A little bit of it. SpaceX sounds cool though. I'll give SpaceX. SpaceX sounds cool. That's cool. Yeah, they couldn't just call it SpaceX. Or like, I guess. But my other theory is that he's trying to basically bankrupt the company, but in a way that doesn't look like he's trying to bankrupt the company. Because if he bankrupts it, but he has like plausible deniability that he was just trying to make it better, then he gets out of having to pay a lot of money. So that's a hell of a... I mean, I like it. It's a hot-earned thing. He still owes like two-thirds of his net worth to this company. Yeah. But I think someone like that is more motivated to prove everyone wrong. Yeah, actually make it the everything app, which is the complete opposite direction of bankrupt. I think that's what he's trying to do. I think there's very, very little chances that happening. Because there's plenty of people who would love to own the app that controls everything in the world. Like, why wouldn't you want that? But that's a stretch for a website where you can just be really mean to people on mind and 280 characters. And you can make a lot of money off that. Yeah. I mean, there are starting to roll out ads. Obviously, we talked about them doing creator payouts and then sort of adding some creator features. And that's at least progress in some direction. But yeah, it's like, it still says tweets all over the website. Like, what's going on on Twitter? It says Twitter all over it's still. If you go to x.com, not logged in, there's a giant button that says join Twitter. Next to the x logo. So there it is. I just don't understand. It's like, I mean, I think we can all agree that it was probably like they were going to do this. And then Elon was like, do now. Yeah, or we'll announce is it. And then everyone in the side was like, oh, we are not ready for this. Yeah. Now they're slowly changing. By the time this episode comes out, maybe they'll only be like seven instances of Twitter still on. Then like the hundred there are right now. But it's been changing a lot this week. It's just so insane that Twitter has its own lexicon. There's, I tweeted this Twitter like, like every it's the thing you want to create. A quote tweeted. There's sub tweeted is like a thing in culture. You know, like, there's all of this stuff. And like, no single brand, except for like Google has been able to like make its thing a verb. Yeah. It's like it's so hard to do that naturally. That like why just like burn away. Seren wrap. I mean, well, yeah, there's a lot of us in short band-aid, Kleenex Qtip, like, that's our verbs. I Qtiped my ear. I won't say that. A swab my ear. I don't know what to say. I'm going to Seren wrap this. True. Yeah. But it's like you just burning all of this like naturally occurring lexicon that everyone would die to have. Is that what are you like strive for? Arguably the most valuable part of Twitter. Yeah. Like when you talk about the most valuable brands in the world, a lot of time it's like what is Coca-Cola other than a couple formulas and some sugar and a bunch of ads? Like the brand Coca-Cola and the mind space that it takes up in most humans like knowing about the thing is the most valuable part of the company. Yeah. And that's true about a lot of the biggest brands, kind of like Nike, Jordan, Google. And I think if you were to argue like what's the most valuable part of the dumpster fire that is Twitter and their headquarters, it's probably their brand value. And to just nuke all of that and call it something totally new that let's be honest, our parents are not going to call it X. But we don't really know which is like what he paid for. And also it's like what he paid for. That's exactly that's the crazy part. He paid actual dollars for it and nuke to the most valuable part of it. Yeah. He didn't really pay for the users because like he did, but there's not that many people on Twitter compared to like a lot of other things. There's one more people who just know about Twitter. And like the Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimmel. One of the mean tweets thing. Oh yeah. Like that everyone knows what a tweet is. Yeah. That's so. Also you go to you go to any newscast or sportscast or anything. Twitter doesn't pay any of these people to have their logo on the screen. They just put it on the screen. That's a free. And imagine how many like companies and stuff that have billboards or signs on buildings or trucks that are going around with like Twitter logo as their list. Or no, just the Twitter logo to go to their social. And now all of those are. Yeah, every food truck in the world. That's the other thing. Every food truck has like an Instagram logo, a Facebook logo, a Google plus logo. And in Twitter logo. Now two of them are dead. And that's just unfortunate. And it's just the SEO of X also like is terrible. What are you this for you type Twitter because you knew what it is. Now it's like X find them find David ML on X like what is going to show up on it doesn't sound Google. What David and I know X X X. Doesn't sound great. This is the only reason why I have that like kind of theory that he's just trying to bankrupt it to get out of the payments because like it seems like the most illogical thing that he could possibly do. But maybe he's a genius in world idiots. Who knows or maybe it's just a bad move and he made a bad move. I think that's just it. Yeah, but I think it's not a bad move. I think they could go back right now. I agree. I think there's just bring the bird backs. People agree to them that it was a good move I guess. And I'm sure there are plenty of people who agree with it. You on around him. I feel like well, and that's not just you on that's every billionaire. Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm bummed. Oh, I'm really bummed. I really hope that things change in the next like a couple of weeks and it goes back. They'll change. I mean, it's just it's a day by day thing. This is like the fourth week we're talking about. And what we're saying now we record on Wednesdays. It could be totally different by Friday. Imagine it's Twitter on Friday. It's back to Twitter on Friday. I don't know, dude. It could be Google on Friday. You know, Twitter plus. I was I was thinking what if what if meta rebranded threads to Twitter? Well, I said they should just call it why. I made that joke actually. I said people are always talking about X but nobody's asking why. That's funny. But Twitter is available now. Twitter is available. If threads became Twitter, it would be like it would be like the Charlotte Hornets. Yeah, like the Hornets went to New Orleans, became the Pelicans, got the Bobcats, and then rebuked the Hornets. Yeah, they should. Yeah, T3. Threads is T3. I'm going with that. All right. Does that make Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Jordan? In the Hornets example. Yeah. He just sold though. Jordan just sold the Hornets. So what does that say about? Look at you. Mark, okay. It would be funny because Mark Zuckerberg has wanted to own Twitter for like ever. And if he ended up owning Twitter, just not the original Twitter, it would be really funny. So I guess, but the thing is as much as we all talk about, Zucker not wanting to be all using apps where Zucker has all of our data, he's kind of been the most successful for as much copying as they do at social media stuff. In general, there's a, I watched the, it was a clip from the Lex Friedman interview that he interviewed, Zucker, about, I don't know, a bunch of stuff, but there was a clip where he literally asked him like, okay, what do you think about what Elon is doing with Twitter? And the answer was really interesting. I'll link it in the show notes so you guys can watch it. But he was along the lines of like, Twitter is an idea that could have a billion users. They just never had the execution and the business savvy behind it to actually get there. And there's no reason why Twitter shouldn't have a billion users. A public town square is a good idea. Like, there's a lot of the things there that make a lot of sense. It's just for whatever reason, Twitter was never able to execute on that. Elon's still trying to execute on that. And then there's some teasing at the end of like, would you do your own thing? And then he was like, what, I don't want to say. But, you know, this is like a month before threads launched. So we kind of all read between the lines in hindsight. But I think that's the zuck thing is like, we'll turn this idea into a billion users. It is interesting. I read a lot of analysis about why Twitter became such a thing that it is. And apparently, it's, well, what a lot of people have said is that Jack Dorsey really had no idea what he wanted it to be. So he just sort of let kind of the people on Twitter create Twitter. And that's why it became like successful. That's why Reddit was super successful. And now they're like, just kidding. Yeah. Screw all that. Yeah. And obviously they get into like weird stuff. And like, you could say that Elon also wants Twitter to just run itself. Obviously, you get into weird moderation issues. And that's like the biggest issue with social media overall. But yeah, I think a lot of people are saying threads, even though it seems like it has a lot of potential, they've specifically been saying like, we don't really want this to be like a news and political place. And it's like that's going to become a thing. It's been weird that they're not embracing the clear, like you need the power users. You need the 1% of people who post the 99% of stuff. And a lot of that is the like fast moving. Like, there's an earthquake right now. Now you all know about it before it even hits you. There's news now. There's things happening. That's like the engine of Twitter. But the thing is like Facebook, right? Like Facebook went through all of this stuff where everyone was like, you're the arbiter of truth now. And so they went through like this insane like congressional hearings and all this stuff. And they don't want to do that again, right? They're so terrified because threads is not even that different from Facebook, right? The only difference that thread has to Facebook basically is that you can follow whoever you want. And Facebook did eventually add that feature, but they were too late to it. So now threads is kind of just like Facebook 2.0, but they are really scared of being Facebook 2.0. Because if they allow this kind of like political thing to take over, and then there's like election interference or whatever, and people like yelling at each other, they really don't want that. So they're trying to put notoriously not the person you want in charge for. Yeah, exactly. It is really interesting to watch the types of things that the algorithms on threads incentivizes. Because you can't just stop people who are being political or newsworthy from being on threads, but you can surface other things more often. And that encourages that sort of behavior. Positive stuff. Positive reinforcement. Yeah, not on. So you kind of have stuff. I assume that when we see things on the homepage, by the way, they introduced a following. Yeah, finally. In the most Instagram way, I'd sort of talk the way I know where to find it, but it's there. But I think they're going to be showing people the stuff they want more people to post. And so when I see the, when I load up the homepage on threads, I'm paying attention to what types of things they're showing. It's a lot of text-only posts. Yeah. It's a lot of people's reactions and actual threads happening. Yeah. Not so much videos. I can't remember the last time I saw a video on my threads homepage. Yeah, so just. Yeah. I would like for threads to be able to replace what Twitter did for me, which honestly was just news aggregation was the biggest aspect of Twitter. There was random, fun, friend interactions and stuff. But the biggest aspect for me was we drop links in the slack all the time. I do go to the verge every day and read all their articles, but I'm not on every single news website every single day. So Twitter is a really great news aggregator. And it's great because if you're mentioning the verge, the verge posts a ton of articles, but the ones that are popular, that are the ones that people are interacting with on Twitter, and then popping up in my face. So it's basically a free way of being like, these are the things people are more interested in. That's what maybe we should talk about this week. It helps us write the podcast. So I would like threads to serve that role for me, but by default that is news. So it's not like political news. I don't think they're going to get away from news that much. It has to get there eventually. It's even be kind of competitive with Twitter. It also needs a web app because it needs a web app so bad. Oh my God. You heard us my phone all the time until like fine news. Yeah, you heard us already with we want a following tab. Thank you kind of. And please give us a web app. Please, please, please give us a web app. I'll leave you with this as food for thought to think about what threads is what it's trying to be, and what we already know Twitter to be. When you open up Facebook and go to the box to post, you know how there's a little bit of a prompt there already, Facebook says what's on your mind? When you open up Twitter says what's happening? Question mark, ice cream mark. That makes a difference. Question mark, ice cream mark. What's happening? What's only that? That's always, for as much as we talk about like the conversations in the public town square or whatever, I always just think of like when we share tweets in the slack, it's like this just happened. This just happened. That's what tweets are. Right. What's happening? Instant. What? Exorcitor. Literally we talked about that Apple insider. It was like posted 30 seconds ago. It was a tweet that we found. Because it just happened. This just got found. I actually found it on threads. Well on threads. On threads it just says start a thread. Oh wow. So that's not a great strategy. Start a conversation. Threads is a start coffee. Cool one man. Start a thread. Just relax. I'm not going to check Macedon or T2 right now. I'm just going to leave you with those. And we'll say threads has a 500 character limit which is nice. Twitter blue people that have more than 200 characters. That's great. Twitter needs to change the way that this works. Because when you hit show more, it brings you to a whole nother page. And sometimes there's only like three more words. And then you have to hit back. I saw one recently that it was one more word. And I was really mad. My gosh. It's just like the waste of my two seconds. They should expand in line. Obviously. Yeah. Why don't they do that? If they expanded in line, it would be amazing. Maybe they want an X's work on it. Would you buy X blue if it did? No. There's nothing we could do. X blue. It's still called Twitter blue, by the way. On the website. It actually is. Funny enough. If you click on the Twitter website and you inspect element, the X logo is labeled Twitter. No. And that's a perfect place to end it. Yeah. That's the state of it right now. Trivia to add break. Trivia to add break. I like sound of that. Yeah. What letter is X in the alphabet? What letter is X now? Quick. All right. 24. Wait. Really? For you, right? 24. Nice. Okay. So we make fun of Sony all the time for their crazy wacky know-to-no schemes. Oh, no. For their naming schemes. Everything about Sony. You might be perfect. Yeah. Okay. I make fun of Sony all the time. But I would say, for example, for item hates K-pop. The headphones, WH1000XM4, but that's a long honored tradition with Sony. For example, the headphones that came with the first ever Walkman was called the MDR3 and was part of the H-AIR series of headphones or hair. Yeah. Crazy. What year did those headphones come out with the first ever Walkman? What is the tradition bad naming? Pretty much, yeah. Oh. I thought there was going to be, I thought it was going to be like the something 1000. So it's like headphone. What does 1000 mean? I don't know. It's just their model. It's just that, yeah. Why is it there if all of them are 1000 means W-H is wireless headphones? One with WF is wireless earbuds. I don't know why it's F. Phonics? Nope. Phones. Nope. You were close this the first time. It's true wireless. What? Yeah. F. That's TF. T-W-U. No, yeah. Wait, it's just F. So why is it WF? You were. What? No idea. You just said it's so much SNF. I just don't get why it's WF, W-H, and then XM model. Like number of it is. What is the XM sound? All of them, I'm even fine with the XM. What is the 1000 for? It's free press because we're talking about the sound. So that's the trivia question. That's true. Okay, so basically what you were in the Walkman come out and ask the question. Basically. I know that. You're really? Yeah, he did a whole episode on the Walkman. I was hoping he wouldn't remember though. I was hoping he was a whole by a year's end. I hope I remember correctly, but I do remember. You want specifically. Yeah, he wants exactly. Do you remember that? I know a year. He said the year. I'll have a year. All right, we'll be right back. All right, welcome back. We got of course some new Samsung stuff to talk about. They've dropped their new Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, S9 tablet series, and watch six series. Our impressions video of the phones is up. I don't know if you guys are interested in the others as much. I am personally very excited about the S9 Ultra tablet. It's hilarious. It's one of the most crazy pieces of tech I've seen. I'm wow. You opened it this morning. This is a Tab S9. We just heard you giggling from your desktop. Just feels like a monitor without a stand. Yeah, the Tab S9 Ultra. It's a 14 and a half inch, $1,500 120 Hertz tablet. I felt you did that last year with the S8 as well. I did. And it's nuts. It's just as nuts. It's just as crazy. I love it. Just holding it. I'll hand it to you. You'll hold it. You'll be like, this is absurd. Okay. It's great. I'm ready. But the phones, I'll just go over real quick that the stuff that's new. Because they are relatively minor. It's quick and easy to summarize. I'll put it that way. The new Fold has a new hinge. It has a new brighter inside screen. And it has a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. That is all that's new. You should definitely have a lot of thinner. It's a lot thinner. It's so because of the new hinge, the entire form factor folds flat and gapless, which is nice. And that also does make it a little bit thinner, flat. I think open is the same. And I believe it's the same size battery, same cameras, same charging speed, same screen size, same aspect ratio, same resolution, same everything else. But you know, chip, hinge, brighter inside screen. That's it for fold. Then you have the flip, which is the same set of things. It is a new chip again, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It's the new hinge again, folds flat. And instead of the brighter inside screen, it is a bigger outside screen. That cover screen. It's a 3.4-inch cover screen now, with literally access to any of your apps. They're basically matching what Motorola did. But it's got a little bit of a cutout around the cameras instead of enveloping the cameras. So this is the Samsung way. It's a little bit safer. But you can do up to, like, there's 12 widgets now on the home screens. You can flip around, go through notifications, do more stuff on the outside. Watch a YouTube video if you really want to. You can do any of the stuff you'd normally do on the inside, just a little more access on the outside. So you don't have to open it as much. That's it. That's what's new. I kind of said, and I kind of proposed this like theory in the video that Samsung is very settled on these form factors. And the more I was playing with the fold after I've recently used the Pixel Fold a lot, I really want like a wider passport size version of what Samsung's built. And I don't think that they would do that in this phone. I think they would just make a whole new phone. Yeah. I think they would just make a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip mini or whatever. Z-Pasks. They would make a new phone. Or something. Exactly. So they didn't do that. So I'm using it. I'm demoing it. I'm remembering all the things about this phone that I like and that I don't like. And that number one thing is still that it's just like a tall, skinny candy bar. It's weird to type on. I don't like watching YouTube videos on it. Nearly as much as David, you tweeted this morning, you're using the Pixel Fold on the outside screen a lot. Me too. It's the best folding phone to use closed. And I think that's what I sort of miss about, this Samsung phone, which is state of the art. Incredible displays. Very solid cameras. Okay, battery. Like it's a solid phone, but I just wish the form factors a little different. And I don't think Samsung's going to do that. I think there's an interesting comment too on Twitter. Keeping the screens the same aspect ratio for developer continuity potentially, so that they can have the advantage of people continuing to make the most apps for their phones. Maybe, I don't know, but that's the new Samsung stuff. Can you use any app on the outside of the flip? You can. Okay. And you can sort of flip a switch to enable. Some will look ridiculous. And the labs feature. Canon should, I guess, are different. Yeah, yeah, you can literally go through the checkbox and same with Motorola. You can just like check the box of like, let me use maps on the outside. And that's actually kind of useful. Let me use YouTube on the outside. You can be a psycho. Cool. Sure. So you can do whatever you want. It's just some may look a little more ridiculous than others. Dang. I think my favorite thing from Unpacked was, and it's not something we want to use, but I just like that they brought back the classic version of the watch in the Galaxy Watch 6 with the like actual physical turning dial. I thought that was really cool on the four. They didn't have it for the five because they had the watch five pro, which had a bezel, but it didn't turn. And then bringing this back, I think a lot of people are pumped about that. Yeah. And it's a little bigger screen, a little thinner bezel. But yeah, if you can do anything with that, like it's a UI, like it's like a digital crown. It'll still move around. Yeah, the UI with it. Clockwise, scrolls down, kind of clockwise, scrolls up, that sort of thing. Yeah, and it protects your screen. Which is nice. Just having that lip is nice to have. Exactly. And then the S9, the Galaxy Tab S9 series. S9 tablet, S9 plus tablet, S9 Ultra. It's 14.5 inch tablet. It's literally almost this big, just holding a touchscreen. 120 hertz bright, 15 inch screen in your hands. It's crazy. It's wild. It's going to snap it up. I'm looking at the half again. Oh, 100%. I was looking at the Samsung website. And they make looking in their ecosystem look very good. Like, I wonder how it would be to spend a week just living with only Samsung things. This was a take that I cut out of the hot takes video. Or I think I threw it in the intro maybe. Somebody said, Samsung's ecosystem is better than Apple's ecosystem. Whoa. Better's a strong word. Better's a strong word. They're also just as good. They're just different. Like, there's just different products. There's no washer and dryer in Apple's ecosystem. There's just different things, right? Yeah. The Samsung smart things and encapsulates a bunch of stuff. There's no smart speaker yet. It's not canceled yet, technically. There's no smart speaker like the HomePod. But I think you could live in Samsung world pretty easily. You could look in your fridge on your tablet. It's pretty cool. Yeah. You've got the nearby share stuff with the computer and the phone. And they have a lot of... They do have a decent amount of proprietary stuff that works with their devices. Yeah. They got really good earbuds. They make laptops. You can use a Samsung Chromebook. You could have a Samsung monitor. You could have a Samsung Windows. On your Samsung laptops. There's a lot of stuff that they make that all work well together. That's true. That's very true. So you could live in that ecosystem. Samsung phone. You wouldn't necessarily have a... Well, you'd have to use Bixby. So... I don't really use voice assistance that much. You don't really have to use Bixby. They let you use Google Assistant now, don't they? Yeah, I guess if you were living in Appleworld, you'd use Siri and if you were living in a Samsung world. They'll only live in that world. Yeah, yeah, fully in it. If you want to commit. But it is an interesting question. They of course all think about ecosystem all the time. It's just one of them's notorious. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting to see the Samsung Flip versus Razer situation and how people respond to that overall. Yeah, I think that's the same phrase. Yeah. This is a $1,000 with the Razer $1,000. Thanks so. Razer Plus. Okay. It is worth noting you have to download a good lock module to be able to run any app on the home screen or on the front screen, whereas on Razer it's out of the box. Oh, for Samsung you do? Yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Okay. But they do have 12 widgets that you can do. There's like a fitness widget and a clock widget and a bunch of stuff. And it looks generally pretty good. I think that it's interesting. Samsung over time because they have wanted to be sort of the Apple of Android and they have simplified things. We've talked about this a little bit with like you know, the S23 phones are pretty much like the default NPC of smartphones now of an Android smartphone. Like what is the absolute base looking Android smartphone? That's an S23. That's like the person that walks into the store and goes, can I have a phone? Yeah. Even for more direct. Specifically, it doesn't want Apple. They're going to get a Samsung. I can't tell you how many people are like, I have a Samsung S20 or like Samsung 20. Samsung Galaxy. Not like Samsung. I have a Galaxy. Yeah, or that. Galaxy series. Yeah, yeah. But like, I think that the reason that they're not doing the same thing as Razer with like the cameras in the screen is because even though Samsung does do a lot of like experimental stuff, like they started the whole foldable revolution, right? They now are settling into this point where they're like, we just want to play everything safe. So let's make the cover screen not go over the cameras. So everyone knows exactly where the touchable areas are. Exactly how this is going to function. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. They'll probably run with this size display for the next like four years. And the size phone. Yeah. For a while. I do. Yeah. Like you said, I really wish they would make a passport style fold because Samsung could knock it off the park. The candy bar for me is still too awkward to use. And it makes you want to open it more often. Whereas like, yeah, the pixel fold, I'm really enjoying. I use it. I'm just going to use it. It's one of it's incredible. I get why Samsung would rather be though the phone. People enjoy more what it's folded out. I don't do you want to be the phone that's more fun to enjoy closed? Or do you want to be the phone that's more fun to enjoy doing the thing that you're paying $18.00 for? That's fair. There's advantages to both of them. There's different. Yeah, exactly. I don't think they're dying to be the phone that's more fun when they're closed when they put so much effort into being the folding phone. Yeah. Yeah. There's just the battery implications. Like, it's kind of, it's got to be at least good to use. Yeah. Samsung also has really, really good trade-ins for their own phones. Someone noticed me today that the full, the Flip 4, you can get $900 for a trade-in on Flip 4. And if you're a student, they have 10% off. So you can literally get a Flip 5 if you have a Flip 4. For basically free, you just have to pay sales tax. Solid, which is insane. And be paying a university to be a student? Yeah. True. Yeah. Then you deserve a detail. Or using your old student ID. We don't get done that. Yeah. A small university. Yeah, their trading's are crazy. I'm really debating doing a Flip 5. Paying like $100 for a brand new phone. Their trade-ins are nuts. And it seems like if you're trading in something that folds, they give you like a very, very good price for it. Yeah. Is that a red flag? Yeah. Get those things off too. They just, I will say, I was in, yeah, I was along the Pacific Northwest coast this whole last week. And I stayed with some random person from Instagram who I didn't know at his house. And he's amazing. He's great. Shout out to Abel. But he had a Flip Gen 2 or Gen 3. I think a Gen 3. And the entire center part was cracked. You know, not in a way that like he dropped it in a cracked, but like the crease cracked it overuse. And he said that that was his second model. And that he had used his insurance to get a new one because it cracked the same way the first time. And he got a new one and then it cracked the same way again. Yeah. And to be fair, that was like, I think that was a Gen 2. So hopefully the screens have gotten better now. But I have seen things about people's foldables cracking. I think I'll still always press it about everyone that he's ever owned. Yeah. And it's kind of crazy that the outrage over that has like died down so much because I used to be a really loud thing whenever one thing would go wrong with foldables. I think we know it comes with the territory now. Yeah. It's crazy. I think that's a good segue though. That's a good segue because our last segment on this week's show is a little bit of show and tell. We're going to talk about some piece of tech that we've used lately or that we want to share that we think is really cool. I'm just telling people about it. I'm going to go first because the segue is I have been very impressed with the pixel folds durability. Just because I, you know, there's like a, it's a notorious thing that these phones are supposed to not last very long. I talked about this last week on the pod. Pour water on the phone, took it to a beach, all these things. It still makes the grinding noises when I open it and close it. And it's fine. It's totally fine. So just shout out to the pixel fold now. I also want to talk for a quick second on Sony's new WF 1000 XM5. So they're out. There's an app now. So we get to test some. Dave's got a pair too. These are the earbuds that are basically designed to sound amazing and be worse at everything else that earbuds are good at. Like they're not supposed to work out in these. They're not supposed to sweat in these. I thought they had an IP rating. They do, but like you wouldn't get these if there's these are not workout headphones. Yeah, I would get so many other pairs of headphones other these for $300. They're like those headphones that are also 300 bucks. It's like, yeah. But I will say they do sound pretty good. It's really good. And they have new processors and they have a new smaller form factor. Now that's the main thing I'm happy about. Just because. Yeah, I wouldn't. The biggest challenge with these is they're always huge. They're earbuds and they sound amazing and they have great noise cancellation, but they're always huge. And these are smaller. And I'm happy about that. And they wireless charge on them. The bottom. Yes. Instead of on like the side. And I noticed that too. Pop it on the charger like that. I love it. It seems like they realized that the Link Bud S, which I love, was a great series in a lot of different ways. And they're like, let's make them the better sounding version. So that's my show until what do you guys have? It wants to go next. I have the current mouse I'm using to play games. This is the Pulsar X2. This is the random Frank P version. Which you're gaming with a wireless mouse? Yeah. No, I've been gaming with a wireless mouse for a while. Okay. I've realized my mistakes. But I was using that crazy like $300 razor Viper mini signature edition. But it was just too small for my hand. And after a while, this, I have to say for 95 bucks, which is a great price for a wireless mouse. It's not any more expensive to get the like, they worked with two different creators. I said this is random Frank P's. Same price. Cool design. It's been a great mouse so far. I'm like dominating my premiere matches in Valorant with it. So you know, it must be pretty sick. But yeah, I just like it a lot. It fits my hand really well. And I think it looks sick. Cool. Cool. Would you say it's better than a magic mouse? Don't answer that. But yes, I have one and a half things. So yeah, I know. I don't know. All right. I'm just going to, the first thing I'm going to like tease a studio video. I have this 3D printed film camera. Oh my god. That uses an iPhone as a viewfinder, which is very cool. Why don't you say you can't buy this? Can people buy this? You can buy this actually. Yeah, there's a yeah, yeah, yeah, working out the kinks. But like there's a few, yeah, there's a few tech angles to this. And that's why I'm making a studio video about it. Can I say what I love about it quickly? Yeah, just looking at it. I love that since it's on the, it doesn't have a normal viewfinder. It still has two levels on top to make sure that your level the one that's on it. It's built into it, which is cool. That's really awesome. It's a camera obscura. So it doesn't have any wires in it whatsoever. Which is really awesome. I've been making some really crazy photos on this from various trips. There's a studio video coming out about it within the next like, we can have to two weeks shooting film shooting film. I was going to ask to hear the shutter sound. I can show you the shutter sound. Oh, is there a film in this? No, I can show you this. It's probably not quite as. Hold it up to the mic. Yeah, do you want it to be one set? Yeah, we'll do one second. One second, bold. Oh, I didn't cock it. That was one second. You can also do like one one 25th where it's a lot faster. Solid clunker. It's in the lens. So anyways, yeah. Cool studio video coming out about that in like a week and an half to two weeks. The main thing I kind of want to talk about is actually software. Which is exactly what happened last time when I talked about ARC browser. Which by the way, ARC browser is officially out version 1.0. So shout out to you guys. Yeah, I can finally recommend it now. You don't need to download a browser. Yeah, you don't need to invite anymore. So go download it. It's the best. But the main thing that I want to talk about was this app called Beeper. And I used to write and make videos for Android Authority. And I've used Android phones my basically entire life up until I started working here. And then it was sort of like on and off. I was like on an Android phone sometimes and on an iPhone sometimes. The thing that's like using an iPhone at all for any period of time will do to you, especially when you make friends who are not in the tech space. Is you start gathering people in your life that force you to use iMessage and that are rude if you don't. In the United States, this happens nowhere else. I still have never experienced this. Yeah, it's because you haven't used an iPhone for expanded period of time. Get an iPhone for like three weeks and you'll see that you guys will be nicer friends. No, I agree. I agree. It sucks. But there's an app called Beeper. Which the point of the app is to actually aggregate all of your messaging clients into one window, which I don't actually like the idea of that. For some reason, I'm a segmented kind of person. But you can log in through your Apple ID and you can use iMessage on your computer and on your Android phone. And it works really well. It has basically all of the regular iMessage features. It's got voice notes. It's got replies. It's got tap-backs. So for me, it's great because I can finally use whatever Android phone I want and not have people get mad at me. It's not worse than Twitter Blue Use. It's wolf. Yeah, I know. People who complain that you didn't have the answer. It's so dumb. And it's only probably an excuse. But I've been using the Pixel Folds. I really like it. So Beeper is very cool. I think you still have to sign up for a wait list. I think I tweeted about it in the developer. It gave me a code. So I'm kind of like. Just try that. I just tweeted the developer. Just like our browser. Sign up for the wait list because it's actually really good. Do you know what does that that doesn't have a wait list? What's up? Yeah. So here's the thing about it. When I logged into my Apple ID because you have to like log into your Apple ID for it to work, I got a notification on my Mac that said an unknown device in Kazakhstan has logged into your Apple ID and was this you? So I don't know exactly how they're making this work. It could be on some old iPhones. It could be on a physical old Mac. It could be on a virtual Mac. I don't really know. So I don't I just have to remote into your computer real quick. What I'll say is I took the privacy risk. I like it. But do it at your own risk. The Cardi B clip of her just being like, that's suspicious. Yeah. I've been enjoying it. I think it's really you deserve to get bullied. I'll try. I'll look in this with a hot taste. I'm sorry. I actually prefer the context switching of different messaging apps. I do too. I use the notification shade as my unifier, but I prefer like when I get an Instagram DM. Yeah. Interacting like an Instagram DM. Yeah. And then when I get a text into interacting like a text, that's just me. Not everybody's like that. But if you like it all in one place, there's an app I can try. I don't want to use the reason that Bieber exists, which is to integrate all of your messaging into one place. You just after the iMessage part. I just use it for the iMessage part. Okay. Because I can run on a Windows computer, I can run on an Android phone. Yeah. For me, that's great. But yeah, I wouldn't want to like message in Slack in a Bieber wrapper. Right. That's weird to me. Yeah, it sounds like well from the office, just everything gets put into one space. And you get sent a million different notifications. Yeah. I guess it's the opposite. But so. Anyway, that's that's my pick. What about you guys show until? Okay. So I'll let Ellis go last because his is dope. Mine is this. I'm on the six A again, just for reasons got bored. But they have a teenage engineering pocket operator app exclusive to the pixel. That's really cool. Really? Yeah, it's really dope. So like, yeah, it's similar to the nothing like beatmaker thing. There was a lot of like teenage engineering. Yeah. But it's that. Hmm. So it doesn't make your phone light like pixel exclusive app. No, that's a rare one. So it has video also. So you can record video and import samples and things like that. That's funny. So earlier today before we recorded, I went into top-down room and recorded a little beat. And this is my beat. And then you can add things. Yeah. I can play these kids with video. So you can see in my face. Oh, that's what you're trying to my thinking of. Mark. Oh my god. Mystery guitar man. Mystery guitar man. That's what you guitar man. Bro, well, that was it. That's my choice of throwback. That was fun. That is such a throwback. I don't know what that is. Wow. Shout out to Joe Pena, old YouTube channel back in the day, Mystery guitar man. Just look it up and you'll immediately watch that know exactly what we're talking about. It was like, I remember when he sort of like hit the scene, it almost felt like this like next level of production quality for YouTubers. Because people were still just sort of like iMovie being their way through skits. And then he was like, it's not even that crazy. But it was just like, it's just I have a thing. I have a thing for like when I can tell that a lot of effort was put into something, I really enjoy watching it. Yeah. And when you watch his videos, you're like, oh, this took forever to make. Wow. Yeah. Shout out. Um, my thing, if you, I put a link in slack. I mean, not in slack in the show notes. Because no, not in the show notes either. In the Google doc, put a link in the Google doc. Of this thing that I got because it's kind of hard to explain. It's just a link called Ellis's thing. It's a link called Ellis's thing. But essentially about a month ago, I found a listing on eBay for a factory sealed Roland V4 EX, which is like a 10 year old video processor that like sits on your desk and it's about the size of a shoe box. And they're easier to find in Japan if you're willing to import them. But I had never seen one factory sealed. This looks like a red means recording video. You should make more of these. You like my little unbox. I like it. Yeah. I was not going to unbox it. Uh, so I'm part of a discord of people who like these sort of things. And I like dropped in the discord. I was like, you know, I just got like a factory sealed one of those. And everyone's like, dude, record yourself unboxing it. And I was like, I'm not trying to like flex on anyone. You know, but they were like, no, we want to see like what it's like in the box. I'm about to give them this 4K. That was my favorite part of the story is you're like, I didn't want to flex on the people in the discord by doing it by like doing it unboxing. And I was like, so you're now filming it on red. I know. I'm just a love red footage. I don't think they know I work here. So I think they were just expecting me to be like, with my iPhone. They definitely are. I'm, but this thing is really cool. And I'm sure I'll talk about it more. Can you give us a quick example of what you would like to do with it? Or like, uh, uh, I have no idea what this is. It's nothing like an afterburner. It's only 10 years old. Yeah, it's only 10 years old. It looks older. Yeah. It does. Um, 2013. It does a lot of different things. But if essentially you can plug a bunch of video sources into it like four specifically. And then it has a bunch of, uh, transitions and keys and wipes and, uh, diffusion effects built into it. And then it has like color processing. Um, it has different like feedback channels. Uh, what does it do? Picture like the year is like 1995. I know it's like, well, that's why I'm saying this looks way older. Yeah. So like picture like 1995. And you have like a big stack of home movies that you recorded. And you want to like put music behind it and like transition between them. You would use something like this to like edit it all together without a computer. But I use it to make pretty pictures. Nice. Well, this is good. This is, this is a good show. I think I should do this more often. Yeah. As soon as we all have something else cool to share. It's nice because like we don't always get to do the most, the latest tech thing. But there's probably something everyone has that they're like, I kind of like this, but we're way past the release date for it. Yeah. Or just randomly if anyone has anything cool to share, we'll just do one person show and tell him, yeah, it'll be fun. With that all being said, we should answer the trivia questions. All right. That was so weird in the unboxing video. Alice posted. He lifted the trick. The, thank you. The lever as the music went on and I thought my computer started making. Whoa. All right. So trivia answers. A quick correction by the way, a couple weeks ago, I asked you guys, what was the first commercially available smartphone with wireless charging? No one got it. So it doesn't affect the points at all. But I said the Nokia 920. A couple people in a discord hit me up and were like, actually, it was the PalmPreet from 2009. I saw a lot of comments about that. Yeah, but the PalmPreet, this is why I didn't choose it because I was debating it. Smartphone. The PalmPreet, you needed to have a different backing and a different charger. You had to buy those separately. It didn't come as the thing. But it was available to buy. So I'll say it was correct. The different backing was just backing that wireless charging could go through or it physically had the company. I hone in. No idea. I think it was a, yeah, it wasn't like a Moto Mod wireless charger on the back. I think you just put the coil in. Yeah, it was like a completely different backing. So, correct. I'm not sure. I didn't affect the scores, but yeah, that's the answer to that. First question, though, comes from Ellis. According to Motor One, what was the world's best selling car of Q1 2023? Oh, you're right. Already. I think we're all good. Yep. Wow. Anyone want to read it? Or Tesla Model Y? Tesla Model Y. Tesla Model Y. Tesla Model Y. Tesla Model Y. To me. To me. To me. It is the Tesla Model Y, which sold 267,000 units. If you'd asked me, I could have gotten close to that, too. Because I had to do a lot of research for the best selling cars when I was talking about the F-150 late now. And I know how many Ys and Threes are sold. So many cars. And in a year, they add up to 1.2 million. And it's about 200,000 each per quarter. It's a fun fact. Wow. I got to say, I rented a Model Y for one day when I was in San Diego. And I don't really understand why people like being high off the ground. It's very much the number one thing people want. It's crazy. It's crazy. Yeah. I think today I thought it felt so heavy and I don't know. So my question was, Yeah. Basically, what year did the MDR-3 headphones from Sony come out? Three. MDR-3. Wait. Oh, yeah. All right. Which is basically what year did the Walkman come out? Right. Also, while we're waiting, quick update on the score. Marques with two after that correct answer. Andrew with one after that correct answer. And David and the lead still with three. Will he hold onto it? Or will Marques catch on? If we all get it wrong, will the person close to get a point? How about that? Wait, that's very close. This without going over. I'll say you can do outgoing over a year. Why not? Sure I can. Do whatever I want. It's very trivial. I think that's so much harder with a year on how long ago it was. Yeah, I would have guessed. Because you're generally aiming probably towards the close to a dream. Do you want to sit at the table for once? T-Shay. T-Shay. You're welcome. I'm in read. You're welcome at the stable anytime. I went seven, three. David and I went very close. I think it is the eighties though. Wait, can you read it out? I said 1973. I said 1971. I said 1989. That would give the point to David. Oh, baby. Wait, you are doing the closest? Yeah, I'm doing close with one over. I just made that up. 1973 is what David said. The year was 1979. So you were the closest. 79, the original walk. Even if we didn't go without it. No, it was closest to their way. I almost said 1988, that was my close. The original walk. Came out in 1979. The very first one. Yeah. I know that we associated it with the eighties, but I figured it must have been the late seventies. Yeah, I probably want to. Well, obviously, I'll give you that came out in 1989. Oh, wait, no, that's the... I think you're doing the yellow one. I'm thinking of the Nintendo Game Boy came out in 89. Yeah. 89. My bad. I thought of the wrong thing. Okay. That's fine. I'm not mad. Thanks for watching. Thanks for listening. Thanks for sticking with us for a little bit of trivia, but also a whole bunch of variety of topics and some show and tell. We'll be back with you next week. Be sure to like, comment, and subscribe and re-ex this video when you see it. See you guys later. Peace. Bye. Wait, from his Bruce by Adam Alina. We're partner with Vock. Whoa. That's what you get for making fun of me in the trivia. Wow. Or I just forgot. I love that you made direct eye contact with Alice. Immediately after you're like, by Adam Alina. Wait for him to be spied on Alina and Adam Alina. And Adam Alina's side face. Yeah. Oh my god. Wait for him to be spied on.

Okay, so this got announced at CES and finally, finally, came out like that a couple weeks ago. That is actually all you had to say. Yeah. That explains so much of what I'm looking at. If this was announced at CES, it finally just came out in June. Okay, so what is this? This computer is called the Lenovo Yoga 9i or Yoga Book 9i. It's a dual screen laptop. Laptop. Yeah. It's strong word. Laptop is a strong word because you can't really use it on your laptop. You can sometimes. There's basically four different form factors of it. I got very excited when I saw it at CES and then a friend of the show. Michael Fisher did a review on it recently and I was like, well, this is kind of sick. Who are you and can that fold? I know exactly. That is, that qualifies. It does fold in half. But it's kind of dope because as two screens, so you can either have it in like dual screen landscape orientation or dual screen portrait orientation. And it's got this like folding, what would you call it? The origami back kickstand. I see that. That also wraps around the exterior keyboard. It's actually very cool. I'll just show it to you real quick. Okay. So you can close it like this. Cool though. Yeah, I'm trying. I'm really trying. And then the origami, not only does it hold the pen, it wraps around the keyboard. Okay. It's got it like that. But then the magnets aren't very strong. Can I hold it? Yeah, you want to hold it? The magnets don't seem very strong on that or this. I thought this was magnetizing to the laptop. No, no. Oh, so you have to hold, you have to carry both. Yeah, yeah. You also have to carry the mouse. So you have to carry the laptop, the case, and the mouse all separately. Yes. Why? Yeah. I know. Is this actually good or is this just kind of a fun thing to report? It's fun. Like, if you're bored with laptops, this is cool, but this is actually not. But there's so many form factors like like that. So like, I mean, yeah, it's like origami, right? Yeah. Yeah, there you go. Magnets. So you can have it, yeah, it like leans back. For audio listeners, I'm very sorry. There's only one angle. There's only one angle. Yeah. And it's, well, no, because there's that. Well, then a top screen, I guess, those more angles. Yeah, I don't know. Anyway, I'm just messing with it. It's fun. It's a fun piece of tech. I wonder about these types of computers sometimes. Yeah. Because I see sometimes the Lenovo Yoga book and all the ones that like flip over and the commercial with like, use it in tent mode. Use it in, yeah, but in tablet mode. Yeah. And they work. And as a reviewer, I guess I can only say like, yeah, they do work. But as a user, I can't help but wonder like, how many people actually use it in these different modes? Lenovo is like the only company that would ever make something like this. Of course. Because they just make so many products that probably nobody buys. Well, off-axis, that screen is blue. Yeah, the screens are not color matched like at all. Oh, gosh. Yeah. So it's running a 15 watt i7 Intel processor, but it's the U series. So it's 15 watts. So like, you probably can't do anything that intensive on this. But personally, like for research purposes and stuff, it's kind of fun. I think ultimately I would rather just use two arc instances on my 16 inch MacBook Pro. Yeah. But I was that guy at the coffee shop yesterday with it. I would do you have a vertical like, yes, I did. So you had the keyboard in front of you. Uh-huh. A screen in front of you. And then on top of that, a second screen because of how you had it oriented oriented. Or oriented. Yeah, oriented. That's weird. Thanks. What were you using it for? Like, what were you writing the podcast? I was doing, I was had the script on the top and I had the websites I was referencing the info from on the bottom. And as someone who uses two screens all the time because I like using two screens, I would never use this as my major. That's what I was looking for. That's exactly what I was getting to. I feel like we're so generous. We're like, oh yeah, it's like kind of cool and the origami and the magnets are kind of strong and I would never use this. Yeah. It's cool and fun and I just wanted to play with it. So that's totally fair. And it's the closest any tech manufacturer has gotten to crumple phone. There's like seven creases in this thing. If not more. That's true. Actually, we're on the fast track to progress, baby. But they did think they get through really well. The origami thing wraps around the keyboard. It holds the pen. Yeah. I can agree with that. It's well thought out. Yeah. There are a lot of clever things that they did to make it do what it does. Yes. I would still not use it that correct. Got it. So I don't know. Yeah, Fisher and I have had a fun time talking about it. I close minded. Is that crazy? I just would never. Whatever. What is tent mode? Tent. Oh. Well, so there are technically five modes for this, right? Right. Tent mode is the thing that Lenovo tried to push when the original yoga came out that was the first computer to like go around 360 degrees. For the audio listeners, David has folded the laptop hinge backwards on itself. So now it's sort of this triangle with two outward facing screens. I'm a tent. Yeah. So I'm always one. I'm a TV. So at this point, you can just sort of do this if you don't want it to be like. Would you ever do that? Well, my Google Doc is on the other side. Yeah, it's shining. It's screen up. Wait, doesn't that turn off? The other screen went into tent mode? No. Which seems badly designed. I also want to play like GoFit or a guest who were battleship or I also want, well, no, because you can't have two mice doing two separate things. You just have to fling that instance back and forth. They're not going to touch screens. They are, but it would like pull focus from your mouse. If I was like working on something, it would pull focus to the other side. Oh. If it could run like two separate mice with two separate instances, and you could just have two people working on two different documents on one computer, that'd be dope. That would be a series processor. That would be insane. It would do the other side of the table. Yeah, I don't know. If you use your laptop in tent mode, please tweet at David and know I want to see the screen. Like, on a run screen, not just like I have a laptop that can sometimes go into tent mode, I want to hear from you if you actively bought a laptop because it can go into tent mode. And then you do it all the time. Yeah. I don't believe you do that. Yeah. Yeah. I also want to know it really quickly that when I took this out of the box, everything worked. And then it had 75 Windows updates, which I'm not even joking. Wow. I installed all of them and then everything broke. All of the like putting the keyboard, oh, because I didn't even show you this feature yet. So if you want to, you could use it like this. And then you take the keyboard out of the thing. And if you put it at the top of the bottom screen, this becomes a trackpad. I've seen that. And so if I'm like a listener's David just took the keyboard, put it on the second screen, and it's like where a normal keyboard would be on a laptop. Yeah. And if you put it on the bottom part of the second screen, you get this thing where either your calendar or your outlook shows up here. And then a really crappy like Microsoft news thing is on the right side. And you can't change this at all. I want to make a video on this called, this is really cool, comma, I would never use it. You want to make the video? I kind of think that's what this is. Yeah. We could. I think I'm I kind of like every UCS product dream. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. You go to see, yes, and you see things like this and you're like, oh, cool. And they just walk away. Yeah. And that's kind of what this probably was. But Lenovo is the only company that actually ships this stuff. Fair enough. But it's just so crappy that you cannot replace this crummy like news widget. It's just permanently there. You can't edit this bar at all. Man. Yeah. It was pretty much Fisher's biggest grape with the thing. Good for you, Lenovo. I mean, not good, but still you're doing things. You're keeping it interesting and I got to give you credit for that. I wish I could use Ark on this, but not on Windows yet. So I'm stuck with Edge. Yes, you are. Or Chrome. Or Chrome. Oh, yeah. Anyway, I actually reset it and it finally works again. Oh, that's good. I'm happy for you. There's another problem, but I think we shouldn't move on. Let's talk about YouTube first. I can. All right. So we had this on the dock. We wanted to talk about this. I actually have no idea how they plan on doing this because they had some steady integration a while ago that kind of sounded like this. But the new headline is that YouTube is testing games on the platform. Yeah. You got games on your platform? The idea is you'd be able to play a game on YouTube.com. That's the whole idea. Yeah, either on the website on desktop or also on iOS and Android. Netflix did this last year. They launched like a games thing. How did that go? It's out in the US. I haven't tried a lot of them. It feels kind of like crummy mobile games. Yeah, I've heard mixed things. One of my friends said that they did it one night when they didn't know what to watch. So they just played the game. And it was like mildly entertaining. And then another friend said they tried it. And it was the most janky thing ever. So they just never used it again. In my eyes, it's like the Chrome dinosaur game when your internet's out. Just a really, really low priority background thing to do. Will you have nothing better to do? It's something Netflix wants to do to keep people on the platform. So that they can serve you more ads or maybe after you finish the game, all of the shows are right there. So you're like, I might as well watch a show. They just don't want you to leave Netflix. And I guess YouTube's doing the same thing. So the the state of your thing from a while ago, from remembering it correctly, was actually kind of cool. It wasn't a cool idea. The integration. Yeah, it was an integration where like never came out. YouTube video about a game where you're let's say playing through a specific level of a game. And if you liked the gameplay, you could actually hit a button and it would jump you into that level of that game where you could play it yourself. So this sort of stadium was the cloud gaming thing and the YouTube was cloud videos and they would all talk to each other. It would be this super cool immersive thing. And I kind of liked that idea, but now stadium is dead. Yeah, it was cool because it was like, there were specific integrations. You could be watching back when YouTube gaming was a thing. Yeah. Before they closed that down. You could be watching someone playing a live stream of a game and they could be trying a level over and over and over again. And if they didn't couldn't finish the level, they could be like, any do you think any you guys could do this? And you could literally like hop into exactly where they were in the game, where their character was with the same items like everything. That was the dream. They never released that feature. But then you know, stadium died. Crazy Google never kills things. Oh, we never even talked about this. By the way, speaking of Google killing things, they killed Google domains. Google killed another thing. Google Tom. That's crazy. Yes, it's crazy about that. What is we just moved Mkbhd.com to Google domains? I have everything on Google. Like a week before they nuke it. All of my time. Great. Yeah. But yeah, so this is kind of a weird thing. Like I could see them being like, okay, well, we made stadium. We did built out a lot of features in stadium. So you might as well like use some of that technology in YouTube if we have an opportunity to whether or not they actually use any of the stadium stuff or they just go the Netflix Brow and make it like really crappy mobile games. I have no idea. I have a prediction. It's a bold prediction. Yep. This will be killed in a year. Well, if it even comes out in a year, because currently they are the only reason this article is posted about this is that they are asking people internally to only at Google to test it. So it's not public yet. Okay. And whether or not it even becomes public in the future, we have no idea. They could just be messing around. But I think it just got leaked that a bunch of internal Googlers were like, oh, my computer just turned off. Wait. Okay. I got it. I thought it was reportedly testing it. Yeah. So this is something sort of behind the scenes that they maybe are possibly working on. Yeah. So I don't know. It's just weird to have these streaming services and be like, we're a weird gaming service now, sort of, but it's not legit games. It's like really weird mobile games. Oh, weird supported games. Yeah. It's like when steam started putting mobile games on steam. And it was just like, because there's Fallout shelter, do you remember that game? It was like a Fallout game, but it was not Fallout. It was like a little just mobile, oh, the Android version. Yeah. But it was not even remotely Fallout. It was like a little like castle game. Anyway. Yeah, just weird. Just more adding weird features to weird streaming services, which is strange. I'm going to we should like place bets on when it would come out and then how long it would take to kill it. YouTube just killed stories like a month ago. Yeah. They're they're chopping things. They are chopping things. Speaking of chopping things. Oh, we also have on the dock TikTok plans on closing down what they initially made basically as a B real clone. It's called what was it called TikTok now? TikTok now. So B real for those who are, let's say over the age of 30, I think it takes right now. Yeah, B real was just a real time or is it is a real time social network where essentially once per day everyone on the app at the same time gets notification and has to take a picture. And it started kind of blowing up. This was post 2020. I don't know if it's associated with the pandemic at all, but it definitely blew up and had this moment where other social networks were like, oh, they had that moment that we don't have on the podcast. Is this a social network or a feature? Yeah, is this a platform or a feature? So for B real is their entire platform and for TikTok, they're like, I think we could make this a feature. Yes. So they made their own version of it where everyone would get a notification at the same time. Instagram has it too. Yeah. What is there is called? I don't know. It has. Yeah. No one uses it. I don't think. I think they'll kill it too. But yeah, I think what we're all discovering is B real has a specific kind of like, I don't want to say cult following, but people use B real to use B real as different as not Instagram as not TikTok. Yeah. So people on TikTok don't want to use it the way they were using B real. Yeah. So yeah, I'm not shocked that this ends up getting pulled, but also that B real is kind of crashed. Yeah. The interesting thing about that is that a parent like B real launched as a way to be the sort of anti social media curated Instagram thing because Instagram stories, which was stolen from Snapchat stories, yeah, just like Instagram became a way to kind of like only post when you're having fun, only post when you look great, you know? And so there was sort of this like anti, especially the Gen Z is like very for this, but like not just posting a curated version of yourself posting yourself in an everyday scenario to make people not feel like comparative against each other. So the whole B real thing was like, it's going to go off at a random time. You have to post it within two minutes. Otherwise, otherwise you get like docked for it. But I think that people liked it at first, but then every single day it was just like people at their desk. Another people in their bed, in their car. Yeah, it is just the same content every day. And there is still a pretty dedicated community to it, but there were reports that the user based dropped 60 something percent, 61 percent between October 22 and March 23. And I think that people are just getting like tired of seeing each other in mundane scenarios because it's like, why am I even on my phone? Yeah, that's six months. That's pretty dramatic. Yeah, it's a pretty good job. B-Roll does dispute those numbers. Of course. But, you know, who knows? And ultimately, yeah, I think it's just like a platform and this feels just like Clubhouse, right? Yeah. Clubhouse, Clubhouse had its rise in popularity like very associated with the pandemic and it was very much like, hey, we're all at home now. But what if I just jumped in a room that's an audio only room? So I don't have to like do my hair and makeup. So I just like show up and people are talking and we have this room of people. And it had this really big social moment. And then every other social network almost feels like every other social network went way to second. We could build that as a feature. As a feature. Yeah. And one by one, they all built it as a feature. And then Clubhouse would still exist, but doesn't really. It's just kind of a crypto thing now. Sort of like a wasteland, like a tumbleweed will pass by and then you'll hear like crypto noises passing back. And you'll be like, ah, it's Clubhouse. Yeah. The feature exists in some other social networks, but a lot of them have killed that. And it's beyond social networks, right? It's in Slack now. Like Slack has rooms now. That actually kind of makes sense. Yeah. It makes like, it's called huddles and rooms. Yeah. I believe. Yeah. Beyond just social networks, just all of these applications were like, wouldn't make sense just to have an audio room. And it was a reaction to the pandemic because people were saying they missed the like random coffee or like a water. Just water cooler conversation. Cooler conversation. Yeah. So it became a space where you could just drop in and sort of just like talk to people. And it was really populated in the pandemic as people are isolated. I also have this really depressing story about Clubhouse that I wanted to say really quickly. So right when it was getting popular, I didn't really know what it was. So I downloaded it. I was like in my apartment with Michael, we were just sitting in the living room. I go into it and there's a room called Quiet Room and there were like thousands of people in it. I was like, oh, so I dropped into the room and everyone was on mute. And I was like, man, this is so cool. At least right. It's like weird. It's like a weird human experience thing where everyone's alone and everyone's lonely but because you're in this silent room, this quiet room, you know that there's all these other people that are having the exact same experiences you and that's like heartwarming in a way. And then I found out I was completely wrong and it was just a follow for follow thing. It was like you go in the room and follow every single user and then every other user follows you. You had this like wholesome like, yes, you in the moment. Yeah. Oh no, this is just F for F. Because I looked at F and I was like, this is so cool. And I looked at like quiet rooms on Clubhouse and there are all these articles. They're like follow for follow quiet rooms and I said, oh my God. I like how follow for follow is like a forever thing in the internet. Yeah, I don't always see a thing. It's always been a thing. Yeah. Wow. So yeah, I don't know why TikTok is closing it down. Like I don't know. I just like never caught on the same reason YouTube's killing stories. It still seems weird to close down features that already exist that you don't really have to like maintain that much. I think it's just like code bloat. Yeah, it's just like bloat on this platform that they don't they want to focus on their core thing. They might as well just remove the distraction. I can see YouTube closing stories because I got a random YouTube story in my feed last week. But only one channel that I'm subscribed to ever post stories. And so it's just weird having like one in a bunch of white space. And I think that's why YouTube closed that down for sure. Yeah. The TikTok thing I have, I don't even have TikTok. So I don't even know what it looked like before. Yeah. I never even saw this feature. Well, literally never even saw it. There you go. Probably like a little isn't it down. Well, we should we got a bunch more to talk about. We should take a break. But of course, that means we should do our first trivia question. Yeah. Trivia. Okay. Trivia, dude. So first question. Twitch is obviously wildly popular for gaming streamers, which YouTube responded to by launching YouTube gaming. It was launched in 2015. One was it discontinued and just made part of the YouTube app. Oh man. Yeah, they had a separate app. There was a separate YouTube gaming app. Yeah. Briefly. For less than a year, I think. I don't know how long. I don't know. You'll get one point for the year, two points if you get the month as well. Well, yeah. That'll be a shot in the dark, but I'm going to try. I bet Andrew gets it when I ask him later. I know. He might know. You might know. I mean, I could tell you that it died. I couldn't tell you when, but I'm going to try. I remember reading the news article about it coming out and downloading it immediately when I read the article. I never used it again. I remember seeing that it was a separate app and I went, ah, not going to use that. Dumbed. Yeah. I was working really boring data and tree jobs. So it was the most exciting part of my day. That's why I like that. That was an Intel. That was a worst company. If that could possibly be one. Anyway, well, we're going to do the answers at the end. So we'll be right back. Fox creative. This is advertiser content brought to you by WhatsApp. Privacy is empowerment and agency. Billions of texts are sent every day. And you may think they're private, but without end to end encryption, cybersecurity expert Matt Mitchell says our messages are anything but secure. Many times there's an assumption that we're having a private conversation with just our friends when we're actually having that conversation in a very crowded elevator filled with random people, some who might not have our best interest at heart. With WhatsApp, your personal messages are kept private by default to understand how we asked Matt to share an ABCs of end to end encryption. A is for asymmetric. With asymmetric encryption, it uses mathematics and we are forging a public key and a private key when we use a product like WhatsApp. This lock-in key exists inside the device itself. When you send a message, it is scrambled the entire time, only visible to you and to the intended recipients. B is for backdoor. A backdoor is a secret way to get in to the message. They can be created by bad actors or hacked in. And C is for cipher. We're talking about the way is that the messages are scrambled and the ways they can be decoded. Almost like a secret decoder ring. So when you send your personal messages through WhatsApp's end to end encrypted platform, you know no third parties can decipher them. The more we use good digital hygiene, the more we protect all of us WhatsApp. Always message privately. This year, Pride Month was dominated by one song, Padampadam by Kylie Minogue. I'm switched on pop producer Rihanna Cruz and this week we're doing a deep dive into Padampadam and it's growing status as a gay anthem leading us to the question. What makes a gay anthem? Is it the diva at its center or is it something more? This episode of switched on pop, I talk to multiple experts and friends to understand how songs like these tend to connect with our community. You can find switched on pop anywhere you get your podcasts. All right, we're back. Last week was a shockingly busy week for devices. Not just last week, but like this time of year is usually quiet. Weirdly, it's really busy. We had to review all the new Apple stuff. And then last week we had two new pixel products, the pixel fold and the tablet. And just yesterday, hopefully maybe, we published these end-phone 10 review. Yeah, we definitely didn't. We never mind. But should I redo? Well, I have thoughts on it. Well, that review may be later, but hey, the pod people get a little bonus because it'll be earlier on the pod. That's true. Yeah, that's true. So what do you want to do first? Yeah, so what do you want to do first? I mean, I guess the pixel tablet we can do first. Okay. Simple one. The pixel tablet, the review is out. It's about what we thought. No real dramatic surprises here. It's an Android tablet. It's a $599, $499 tablet that comes with the dock in the box. And the dock is like this magnetic speaker dock, which has pins and you just pop it on there. And it becomes like a home hub. You pop it off and it's a tablet. Cool. My main discovery when actually using it for a while was the speaker dock is not that good. Great. Yeah. It's fine. Like the speakers themselves on the tablet are completely lacking any base. Yeah. They're very tinny. So when you pop it onto the tablet dock, it actually sounds much better because you get like all this base goods a much larger driver. But it doesn't actually get that much louder. And so when I compare it to like the $229, obviously it's pricey for a home speaker, but it's cheaper than the tablet. When I compare it to that, a Nest Hub Mac speaker, the Nest Hub Macs is much louder and has better mics from far away and can be a security camera which the tablet can't and is on 24.7. But you can't pop it off and use it as a tablet. So it kind of exists at the top of the home hub lineup, but at the bottom of the tablet lineup, I'm curious if you have thoughts on it, but I thought it was all right. I think the Nest Hub Macs has better audio though, right? Yeah, 100%. Yeah. Like a lot better speakers. Yeah. Definitely. So you're really paying like almost actually more than double to have the tablet. For the ability to pop it off and use it as a tablet anywhere. That's sort of the weird sort of thing with this product is that if you remove the separate, like that you can buy another speaker dock separately for $130, if you removed this the whole speaker dock thing from it and you're like, oh, this is a $270 pretty good pixel tablet. You'd be like, so this is a really good price for an Android tablet. It's running a tensor chip. It's like pretty good like very good price for a tablet. But in my head, and I think this is how Google is marketing this thing, it is a, well, I guess their marketing is the pixel tablet, but I see it as a home hub that you normally use as a home hub. That every now and then you're like, I want to watch Netflix on the couch, every now and then you're like, I need to move the ingredients for this recipe over to the other side of the kitchen. So you move it over there. And I don't think Google really wants you to take it on the road that often. They just sort of like added a USB-C port so that if you did, they technically could. Do you think they should have done it the other way around? Like right now, the only way you can buy this tablet is as a $500 bundle with the dock. Do you think they should have sold it as a $300 tablet without the dock? I think that I would find that easier to recommend. I think the dock being $130 is ridiculously expensive, especially considering the speakers aren't good. If the speakers were, okay, and here is another thing too. There's a story that went out that said, Google removed the Wi-Fi chip in the dock. They originally were going to put its own chip in the dock so that it could be a separate smart speaker, which makes a lot of sense. If you- Because you can buy these separately, right? So if you could have these just like, they're basically home speakers just sitting around your house. And even if you didn't have a pixel tablet on it, you could be playing music from it. You could be using them as assistants. 130 bucks for a smart audio speaker is about what a smart audio speaker of that quality costs. Like a Nest Audio is like what? Like $100? Not even. Yeah, I think they're like $100. They have good audio. So if you could basically buy a Nest Audio that you could also pop a tablet onto to charge and use as an interface- I think I'm going to fill a little one. Then this one. Then Nest Audio. That one, yeah. How much is $100? $100. Yeah. For $130. Like that's okay. But the fact that it's $130 for a thing that is a brick. It's a brick when there's no tablet. When there's no tablet on it. Yep. It's like- It's tough. Why would you buy extra of these? Like you're just going to have things plugged in that do literally nothing unless you figure that oh, maybe I'll move the tablet over. Here's a- Here's some other context. For the same money, you could buy a Nest Hub for one room and a Nest Hub Max for another room. And still have money left over. Yeah. Because the Nest Hub is $100 and the Nest Hub Max is $230. That's $330. That's better audio on the matter of fact toss in another Nest Hub. That's $330. You're still under. Wow. $430. So you have a Nest Hub in the bedroom, a Nest Hub in the living room, and a Nest Hub Max in the kitchen. Or you could put a Nest Audio somewhere. Yeah, exactly. And you're still spent less than this tablet with the one dock. That's crazy. So it's like- It feels like because it's a tablet it's a really good price. Yeah. But it is- It is very interestingly placed. Yeah, I have a question about that. Yeah. So you know how sometimes people will release a product and they can charge whatever they want because it's the only thing of that product? Is this one of those moments where because there's nothing that's a one-to-one, it's the same- I don't think it's charged whatever they wanted. I don't think that people want Android tablets badly enough that they can charge whatever they want for this. But the only thing that could convince me, yes, is there was that moment on stage at Google I-O where they sort of teased it at first and they showed the tablet and they showed it, clicking on to the dock and everyone went, oh, yeah. That's cool. Including Andrew. Yeah. And it is the only one that does exactly that. And so if you do picture yourself using that particular feature a lot, then there is no comparison. Yeah. This is the only one you can get. So then follow up question, how long does that remain true? How long before Lenovo makes one? How long before Arnie has been making this kind of thing? It's not exactly the same. I'm off of a speaker. Yes. Interesting. They made one years ago in 2018. Google is like, okay, you use the Google Home app, and you use all Google services, so you get the Google one. Yeah, that makes the most sense. Yeah. As of right now, the way my tablet lives in my house is it's on a folio case. It's in a folio case all the time and it's just like... Plugged in, apparently. It's not even plugged in. It just wanders around the kitchen and eventually it's plugged in when it's about to die. Yeah. Yeah. Almost the same thing. My speakers are loud enough that it's actually the same thing. Yeah. So it's just weird because they marketed it as pixel tablet, but that's not in my head what this product is. It's a Nest Hub large, always worse audio. Yeah, with worse audio. That can also be called a tablet. Yeah, it's a hub. They should have called it Nest Hub tablet. Nest Hub Ultra Go. Or Nest Hub Tab. Nest Hub Tab Go Ultra. Tablet. If you had better specs, you could call it Ultra. I don't know. Yeah, it's just because it's the biggest screen. Yeah, it's a... Yeah, but it's 60 Hertz. It's the display's fine. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, it's definitively fine. Bad off-axis viewing angles, but whatever. There was a little bit of questions for me and this can kind of bring us into the pixel fold of the tablet app experience. Yeah. Because this has been a thing we've talked about every single time there's a pixel. Any Android tablet at all is, oh, well, are the apps going to be better? Yeah. And there was always a small handful of apps where you're really impressed and then the rest of the apps, you're like, oh, no, it's not better at all. And things like Instagram and Twitter aren't exactly grown on the iPad either, but you can keep going down the list. And YouTube Studio is not optimized on the tablet. A lot of my mobile apps that are on the inside screen with the pixel fold, like my golf app is not optimized. It's just a lot of apps still aren't great on the tablet. So that's still a thing. The new weather app is awesome. Yeah. Google made a weather app. They did make a brand new weather. Yeah. I'll give them that. But I think that's specifically for you. I always talk about weather apps in my area. Listening. Yeah, we can talk about the pixel fold because this has been in my pocket for, what, almost two weeks now. Yeah. And the review of it is also out. And it's a weird phone that I kind of actually like a lot, but I realize I won't be recommending them most people. Also fun fact. I played a beach tournament over this past weekend. And this phone was in my bag at the beach for three straight days. And it somehow hasn't died. I actually didn't put it in the Ziploc or anything. I know there's got to be some sand in here. It's like a ticking time bomb. Ron Amadeo over at ours Technica. Yeah, he literally only used this on his desk. He hadn't even moved it from his desk while he was writing about it. He should have taken it to the beach. I literally want to a beach for three days. He might have just gotten super unlucky. He gets unlucky very frequently with a lot of devices. I like it does. Yeah. So the thing about this phone is that it folds completely flat. And can I see it really quickly? Yeah. When you open it, there's not really much space between the bezel and the screen. It's just kind of there. Wait, I thought the thing is that it doesn't fold completely flat. It does fold completely flat. It doesn't open completely flat. It doesn't quite open. It opens to like 177 degrees. So closed, it is a flat sandwich with no air gap. Oh, I see. I see. Yes. It's nice. And I do really like that. I think the problem is they have this like screen protector that doesn't see the edges. It doesn't completely go to the bottom. Which very much feels like a Galaxy Fold Gen 1. I might do it with anyone. Yeah. Because they had to add these before they sent out production units while they were like they had them in reverse hands. They didn't have these like caps in the top and bottom that kept dirt and debris from getting in. And the fold, it's just raw OLED underneath the screen protector. And raw OLED is very dangerous. And so I guess Ron had like a piece of dirt or dust that got onto the little bezel part that is raw OLED. And because he when he closed it because there's like almost no space between the bezel and the actual screen. You just clap and sand and directly into raw OLED on his desk too, right? Like, so. So just have a desk to just cover it in sand. Yeah. And it's like I only use it on my desk. I don't know. There's a lot of sand here. I would say if you do buy this thing, you should definitely get the like pixel protection for it. Yeah. Because yeah. Here's what I'll say. Clearly Google was very protective. It seems like they sent out a lot less of these phones for you. Like there are being very cautious with it. I felt like I was reasonably normal with mine. Like I have some nicks on the top. I have some nicks on the bottom. I took it to a beach. Yeah, the camera area looks kind of scarred up a little. Yeah, it's a little scarred up. Yeah, I really used it. Yeah. And my conclusion at the end of the day was this is the best folding phone to use while closed. Yeah. I use this phone closed all the time like normal. And I really only open it once in a while when I go, you know what? I've got 15 new emails. Yeah. I've got some time to burn. Let's get into it. Uh-huh. And then I would open the phone and I feel like a productivity monster. And I would do that for a while and I close it and use like a normal phone again. Yeah. It's the best at that. Yeah. That's like really what this phone is most awesome at. My least favorite thing about this phone is you cannot have a different layout on your home screen on the inside and the outside. Yeah. Yeah. So just for our listeners who are a little confused about what I mean, every other folding phone, I think every other folding phone. Yeah. The outside home screen is one setup, is one phone. And then the inside when you open it up to your inside screen, you can set up a completely different phone. You can have a different wallpaper. You can have a different set of apps and widgets. So on your outside screen, maybe it's a little cramped. You might have your texting app. Maybe your Google Maps, a couple things you access really quickly just on one home screen. But then you open up on the inside. Whoa. But then you open up on the inside. It's hard to open, guys. It's hard to open. And you end up with a whole bunch more space. So you do like two or three widgets and your games and your apps that you use all the time. Yeah. On this one, whatever you do on the inside screen, will immediately be reflected on the outside. Yeah. If you have three home screens on the outside screen, when you open it up, you'll have the exact same three on the inside screen. And you can't have them different. I will say that I like that if you're using an app on the outside screen, and you open the phone, it's immediately in that app. I like that. But I think that Google did some tweaks to Android for large screen devices and folding devices to make it so that when you have it open, it kind of sees it as two displays. Right? Because when you have it open on the inside screen, it kind of artificially sets a home screen. Yeah. If you had the home screen on your folded on the phone folded and you swiped to your second display, that second display is the right side of the inner screen. Yeah. So screen one on the left, screen two on the right. And the only thing that spans is the Google search bar. Yep. Actually, weirdly, that's the only thing like you can't, like you can't place widgets in the center. Yeah. Yeah. I hate it. And I think they did that. This was the biggest problem with the Microsoft Surface Duo, by the way, is that the Microsoft Surface Duo didn't see itself like that. So when you had it open, it thought it was just one big display. Yeah. So when you would span apps, it wouldn't split them. It would just have missing text in the center. You could have missing pixels. Yeah. So I think they intentionally did it. So they were like, okay, this is screen one. This is virtual screen two. And when you have it open, let's just blend them. But again, like you said, the problem with that is that you can't have different setups and like different orientations of screens. You would have a different type of setup. Yeah. So it was a little weird that that would, like it's an Android phone. I feel like if there was a folding iPhone, of course, they would do that. Yeah. I figured the Google one would let me change. Yeah. There should be at least be a setting for it. And that's something they could probably update. Yeah, they could probably update that. Yeah. It is, I will say the form factor of using it closed is amazing. Yep. It's more find and to ask, which please, Oppo, please, for the love of God, make a global version of that phone because the bands in the West don't sound better than the Oppo. You like it better? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I might need to try a smooth tensor, it's smoother on this phone than any other sensitivity. Crazy. I did think that was weird. That is weird. It's the smoothest 120 hertz Google Pixel phone ever. Do you like it better than the fold? Then the Galaxy Fold? I, yes. Yeah, I hate the form factor of the Galaxy Fold. And that's because the fold is kind of narrow. Awkward to use while closed to narrow. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I mean, the hardware is really good. Well, yeah. Yeah. It's $1,800. Yeah. So is Samsung's. That's true. But Samsung has a better inside screen, has thinner bezels, which does mean you need a weird hole punch. Or under display. Under display. Well, but they had thin bezels before they added the under display, selfie camera. Also true. So it had been a hole punch. But Samsung has better inside display, Samsung has bigger battery and better battery life and faster charging. And the cameras are about on par. Does it have a better software experience? Would you say no? Pixel is better. Pixel's got the software for sure. So, yeah, that's kind of tid for tat there. Yeah. Yeah. 30 watt charging, right? 30 watt max. But it has wireless charging. Pretty poor battery life. Yeah, that's a bummer. I've read all the reviews that didn't mention their battery life was as bad as mine. But I've continued to use this phone and continued to have subpar battery life. Yeah. I read Alison's review on the verge and she said that the benefit of using it closed all the time, which she also said, you feel like you can use it closed all the time, is that you'll get a little bit better battery life. But I didn't really, she didn't really seem to go into detail about the overall battery life. So that logic tracks perfectly. From my experience, I am using mostly the outside screen. Yeah. And my battery life is subpar. Therefore, if I use the inside screen more, I would have even worse battery life. That's my angle. Yeah, that's so fortunate. Tough. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, for you fold the pixel fold people out there. You should be the first wave of people should be they were receiving them today, which is Wednesday. Yeah. So let us now tweet at us about your experience. We'd love to know more people's experience about this thing. I like the phone. Second gen one, hopefully, will be amazing. Android 14 update coming soon as well. Yes. Let's talk about this info in 10 real quick before another break. I do have some thoughts. I mean, we, so this is info nine last year. Amazing. I love this phone. Epic. This phone, I gave it some awards. I'm pretty sure I gave it that small phone. And maybe the most improved. Made it serve and else. Yeah, probably most. I really liked it. A awesome software experience. Super smooth. 120 hertz. They put the latest Snapdragon chip. It had amazing battery life. And very impressive cameras. Like across the board. It was small. It had a fast fingerprint reader. And it was 699. It was a really well priced phone. And it was the most recent. It was the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus. Right. Which means it had the best TSC. So really good battery life. And after that phone came out, I was like, yeah, they basically made the perfect phone. It doesn't have wireless charging, but like, I don't know. The only thing really bad about it is that back coating got so really gross. So fast. So then when I got the email about a Zen phone 10 coming out this year, I was like, oh, right, I forgot about that. What are they going to do with this phone this year? And it showed up. And I like put it on a wireless charger jokingly. Like, I bet they didn't add wireless charging. And it lit up and it started charging. And I was like, whoa, wait a second. I remember this moment. They did. I saw this happen. Oh my god. Yeah. And they did also change the coating on the back of the phone. Now, I haven't been able to daily it as much yet. Because I've been doing the Pixel Fold review. So I'm about to switch to it. And we'll see how much it starts to wear. But I suspect they changed it to make it better and hopefully not wear as fast. Which if that's true, they did everything. Yeah, they basically made the, and it's so, it's like, is this one also 699? It is, I got a double check, but I don't think, yeah, it's the same price as yours. That is insane. I don't know how they pulled this off. I love it. It's basically like the iPhone Mini for Android users. It's got like the Max specs. It's got, but it's got better battery life than the iPhone Mini by far. Dramatically better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like so good. Yeah, I don't know. If you only buy your phones at carrier stores, you can't get this. I don't think so like buy it online, but I think be an H sells us phone. But ASUS is pretty underrated. I think their camera experience is really good because they don't lean super hard into computational photography. So they have more contrast than a lot of manufacturers because they don't go super hard on the HDR. Yeah, I think that's a good look. And they generally score very high in the blind smartphone camera test. This is true. Whenever we do the blind tests, it kind of has a a pixily look in a way. And I think people don't really expect that. And it's actually kind of confirmed to be an ASUS thing because the ROG gaming phones also have a camera. What you're like, it's a gaming phone. Who would ever think it's good, but ASUS is good. Really good hardware or software. I will say one more thing. What was I going to say? They count with new colors. There is there's a nice there's a nice green. There's a nice blue. There's the orange from last year. There's a white and there's a black. And the red is like brighter. You have the orange. It's more red. I guess you're right. Yeah, it's more red. Yeah, it's brighter. Yeah. What was I going to say? What was I going to say? Well, Marquez is struggling. Last year when the Zenfone 9 came to our office, we're all seasoned vets here. We see a lot of phones. So it takes a lot to impress us. But I remember when the Zenfone 9 showed up, it was one of those things where Marquez took out of the box and the whole studio was swarmed him. What's that? Oh, that looks new. That's different. Oh, I like the way this feels. I've always loved the Zenfones because they made the first phone. I think the Zenfone 7 or maybe the sitting, it was the 6, I think. It had the flippy camera. Yeah. It had this camera that it was facing the back. But then if you pressed the button, it would flip around. It was really cool. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I never remembered what I was going to say. So that's hopefully it'll hit me again later. Do you remember that at lunch? Yeah. But Zenfone 10, I am very happy that the things that they should do. 699 is legit insane pricing. It's so... Oh, that's what I was going to say. The... Let's go. So... If Asus, if I was to make my own phone, Asus did something that I think I would also do, which is in the setup process when you first get the phone, you go through like signing to your email, sign up, WiFi or whatever. Yeah. And then you literally have a menu where it's like, do you want pure stock Android or do you want our like Asus Optimized? Zen UI. Yeah. And you get to... I don't even if they... I don't think they even call that anymore. It's just like Asus optimized. Oh. And it has a couple new fonts, a couple new icons, a couple extra features. And you can just choose. You go through like four or five panels where it's like home screen setup. What do you want? Stock or Asus? Yeah. All right. Launcher. What do you want? Stock or Asus? That's cool. And the whole thing. And quick settings. What do you want? And so you go through and you set up the phone. And so right off the box, you're already like, customizing it like a true Android. That's awesome. Should be. It's great. They did that because I think when the ROG phone three came out, I remember people were not super happy with the gaming, the insanely hardcore gaming UI that the ROG phone had in the one and the two. So when the three came out, I remember they made it a big deal. They were like, we're letting you like use stock Android on this if you want. So you get the gaming prowess and all the features of the gaming phone, but you don't have to use the ROG vaults with all the hardcore. Hard game mode. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. And then they ported that to the Zenphone on like the Zenphone six or something. And everyone was like, this is the best thing ever. Yeah. They're still do though. And it's like broken down into like sections of the phone. That's awesome. Yeah. Didn't used to be that way. So that's cool. Shout out to Asus. Shout out to Asus. All of the tests is on phone 10. I hope there's no surprises where it's like, oh, it turns out the battery life is trash now. Like I hope there's nothing like that. But I have a pretty hard time believing I'm going to find anything like that. Yeah. It was great battery life last year, especially for a tiny phone. So that's that. Cool. Plus like another quick break, but we should of course do one more trivia question. This is new light colors from last year. No, this is the same as last week. Okay. I think trivia. Maybe a pink trivia. Yeah. I think trivia. I like it sparkly. It's fun. Magenta. Yeah. Anyway, fun fact guys. WWDC wasn't always called WWDC. Really? The first one in 1983 was called A. Macintosh developers world gathering the MDWG. B. The Apple Independent Software Developers Conference or AIS DC. C. The Santa Clara Developers Symposium. SCDS. Or D. The Global Electronic Information Coders Open House. Or the GE ICO. Guy co. Guy co. Guy co. I wanted to know. I can't be. But I wanted to be. It's so funny. Could it? Oh man. It could be. I don't know. L.S. questions are often tricky. L.S. questions are the one that leave you staring at your bedroom ceiling at night. Yeah. Yeah. This is interesting one because I don't know the answer. Yeah. I was going to say Macworld. Cool. Well with that, we shall take a break. Bear it back. All right. Welcome back. Let's talk about EVs. Welcome to the Wave Form. Or non-podcast. Wave EV form. The EV section. Yes. There's really only one piece of news that matters in the EV world in the past couple weeks because it's been happening over and over and over again. Every day. As dominoes continue to fall and hit each other and knock over other dominoes and more dominoes, we'll continue to fall in the future probably between by the time we record this and this comes out. There will be another domino. Definitely. But the news is there are two basically competing charging standards in North America for electric cars. There is Tesla's port which you've all seen on Tesla's. It's called NACS, North American charging standard. And then there's the other one, CCS. I mean, there's some others that you've probably seen in some other cars. But CCS is the other big one for fast charging. And that's the one that you see for public charging. And every other EV that's not a Tesla. And we've talked at length about this and how there are a big difference between the quality and availability and uptime and reliability and ease of use of the Tesla Supercharger network and every other public charger network. So the news is all these EV manufacturers are slowly actually pulling a trigger on signing a deal to have their cars use Tesla's Supercharger network. Yeah. And that includes them starting to ship cars with Tesla's NACS port in 2025. Amazing. And giving them access to thousands and thousands of Superchargers. Not just the like seven that we have with the magic dock. Yeah. But actual like native, hopefully maximum fast charging. Yeah. And that is a big deal. So that started, I guess maybe it was last week. With Ford signing a deal. Yeah. I did this whole event on, I guess it was a Twitter space. Twitter space. I think it was two weeks ago. Probably something like that. Yeah. I think shortly thereafter GM announces that they're also going to do it. So when Ford does it, you're like, wow, F150 Lightning and Mustang Machi just got better. Then GM does it and you're like, oh wow. So now the Hummer EV is in there too. The Cadillac, Lyric, whatever. Still not. Still not as many cars as. Not a ton, but like, hey, that's two big companies that are actually going to do this. That's cool. And then more Domino's fall and more Domino's fall. So now what do we have? We got Rivian. We got Rivian saying them move over. So R1T and R1S. Yeah. And then R2. R2 when that platform launches. R2. That's going straight to NECS. Yeah, yeah. Straight to Tesla's port. So that's cool. You got Volvo. Volvo's moving over. And which Volvo owns Polestar. So that means Polestar is going to be moving over. Probably. And they haven't said it yet, but I'm sure they will. Logically it checks out. Yeah. We weren't on the street as Hyundai is thinking about it. Yeah, they've been evaluating. Which I wouldn't be shocked if that Domino fell on that also meant Ionic 5, Ionic 6, all of the EV 6s, all those, those all fall. And those all get better in 2025. Like that is a lot of shake up in the world of North American EV plug charging standards. Yeah. It's great. There's a couple funny things about this. One, it's just funny that of course, Tesla called it North American charging standard when it was literally just their port. And CCS stands for Combined Charging System. So it's funny that it's becoming the standard. Another funny thing, they just start rolling out the magic docks, which allows NACS to like pour over to CCS. And that's going to be potentially irrelevant if every single car I start using Tesla. It's good for everyone who's already bought an electric car with CCS. Yeah, totally. You know, the Rivian I have now, all the other cars that are out now, those will be fine to use on a couple of chargers. Yeah, the other funny thing is that Tesla's in Europe have to legally use CCS. They always use CCS. This is why I always practice this by saying this is a very North American thing we're talking about. Yeah. Because in Europe it's like, oh, we've all already had this we've all had CCS for a long time. Yeah. So there was a video by who's like I that makes like two hour videos on Blender technology connections. Technology connections. Yeah. That's my favorite channel. Yeah, he made a video because he his friend bought an Ionic 5 and he was like, this is an opportunity for me to make like three video three two hour videos about electric cars. Okay. So he made a video about NACS versus CCS kind of and like all the technology behind it. And you just see like the size of the cabling and like the ports and everything and it's just hilarious how much smaller and like more efficient Tesla is able to be. It really is. So that port is just way better. So I feel like if people like people moving over to it is both going to be like we did a road trip right. And I had a terrible experience in the Misting Mocky because of the ecosystem of chargers. And now it's like if you can you can basically buy any electric car. You want the biggest problem that the biggest reason that it felt bad to recommend anything but a Tesla was if you drive more than 250 miles on any given day, you're going to have a bad time. Any road trip. Yeah. And I made that video on the autofocus channel about how electric cars are really hard to recommend not because the cars aren't good. The cars have gotten really good to the point where like many could argue Tesla doesn't make the best electric cars. But they are by far the best selling because the infrastructure the availability of these easy to use chargers is so dramatically better. And so yeah this news is a win for everyone I believe. Yeah. It's a win obviously for Tesla because not only are they going to get a bunch of licensing money but I believe they get a bunch of government money because now they're eligible because hey we make chargers for everyone. So that's huge for Tesla. It's huge for all of us because if we are going to buy an EV we want better charging infrastructure and we all just got it. And all the car companies who make EVs who to themselves are saying we make a better car than Tesla. Yeah. But the only reason they don't buy ours is because Tesla is a charging network. Yeah. Well guess what? Now we have a lot of the charging network available to us. So maybe they'll buy more of our good cars. Yeah. So it's great too. I mean we'll probably see some sort of a down the line effect of like how many overcrowded chargers are there going to be? How many people are going to sign up and not be able to actually charge on them? Who knows? But I just feel like it's a win at the start. Yeah. So some good news too is that charge point ever charge an SK signet there may be even more. But there are these third party chargers like Brandon and I when we were doing the CV road trip with the monkey we probably stopped at seven different brands of third party car chargers on the road. Which is crazy. The amount of third parties that there are that do electric car charging is crazy. Yeah. None of them care about uptime it seems like. Maybe they will now. But a bunch of them are starting to also say either we're fully switching over to NACS now or we're also going to offer NACS. That's cool. Which is really cool. So you're going to have third parties too. Which is good because if you have a million cars but only a 100 gas stations that's a big problem. You know, it's like Tesla's supercharger network is the biggest in the nation by far. But you already have problems with there being too many Teslas and not enough stalls. And now there's about to be F-150 lightnings and whatever else is felt there. All the different different sizes and types of vehicles. Yeah. Which was already a question mark with the magic doc. But yeah, that that remains a thing to be solved. Yeah. Future question that will will cross that bridge we get to for sure. And Washington and Texas are now. If you if they give you funding for EV infrastructure you have to offer NACS now. They just made that a law. Nice. So so that's like it's like the USB-C iPhone rule. Yeah. It kind of feels like you didn't have to mandate the port. But all right, I guess that's where we're going. Yeah. Yeah. It's yeah. You know what this all reminds me of? There's been more and more cybertruck sightings. I think it's actually coming out this year. Is that an insane take? I think it's actually coming out. You want a bet? I think it's I think it should make it better. You want a bet? Right now in the podcast. It is not coming out this year. Okay, this is a great bet because we're like halfway through the year. We got six months. Yeah. I've just noticed like them. Obviously they're they've been working on it, testing it, whatever. But suddenly there's like dozens of them. There's like mules, there's camouflage ones, they're testing like finished ones. And well not finished, but dramatically different from what they showed us. Because I remember when I was at the impressions event, however many years ago that was like 2019. Yeah, it was it was at least two, three years ago. And well, how's four years ago? I wrote in one. It was very different. The front was just like a marble shelf that looked ridiculous. It was a three-seater in the front and the back. It was a very different looking interior. And the ones that are rolling around now have a real side view mirror, have a real windshield liper, have different looking lights. I believe removed some of the features, like the the the deck lid that goes all the way to the bottom when you open the trunk. So I don't know all of the details. But it's just a very different looking truck that clearly they've done work on. And now they're sort of testing it. And just with enough frequency, I feel like it's ramping up at the same rate where, I don't know, I feel like they could probably ship them in like six months. I would bet against that. All right, so your answer is no. So the bet is just so we can codify it. Yeah. Well, the first Cybertruck deliveries to real customers happen before or after December 31st. 2023. I also want to clarify what are we qualifying as deliveries? Is it like one or three or like a thousand? Remember what they did with with a plaid? Yes. Where they had a delivery event and the first 25 cars. That's exactly what I what I mean. Like if it does that count, if they do that, if those people are not Tesla employees, that counts. So if they release 25 of these, it counts. Yes. Because they're going to keep shipping them more than next year, I think that counts. But especially if they have like a delivery event in November, and then they start shipping them in December, and there's like like real Cybertrucks on the road. That to me would count. That would count. Yeah. I how much did they say this was originally going to start at 40? We have. Well, back in the day, when they brought me their promises, I think it was like anywhere from 35, 40 to like 75, 85, something crazy. There's a huge because there's a single motor, dual motor, triple motor versions. There was different battery sizes. There's all kinds of things that they promised. They said it starts at 39,900. So 40, 39. My additional prediction is that will not happen. Oh, no, yeah. They're going to start with the most expensive triple motor variant. For sure. No, but I don't think it will ever sell for 40. Yeah, that's also probably a good bet. Yeah. I think they're going to pull a Rivian and jack up the price by 20 grand. I mean, that's happened with the Model 3, right? They promised that they're going to make several different versions, and they start with the most expensive, highest margin version and work their way down. Whether they get to the bottom or not. Who knows? But the price of the Model 3 has fluctuated in real time, depending on the week. But I feel like the Cybertruck will never, they will just be like, we had to jack the price by 20 grand. Like Rivian did. That's exactly what Rivian did. 20 grand? The fifth, so the cheapest one would be. I think the cheapest one of this is going to be 55 or 60. Yeah, I could say 50. I agree. They said they could make it cheaper because it's like a solid piece of metal that they don't want to sculpt in whatever. And that's why it's all jagged. But I don't think that it don't think it's going to make it cheaper. They added like seven years of development with this thing that they have to make up the R&D cost for a lot. They also do have an absurd number of pre-orders, though. I don't know how many people are actually going to follow through with them. It was like, like, a hundred bucks to get in line or something like that. So it still is. You can order right now. I just put a lot of people in line. Okay, so if 25 of these come out this year, that counts. Should we set a number is 25 of the fairs? I think 25 is a fair number. 25 is a fair number. Okay, I'm still saying no. You're saying yes. I'm saying they will. David. I'm saying no. That was absolutely not. Yeah, Stan's alone. Look at me and Optimus. Did you see that? Have you seen that Tom Scott video where he goes to the building in Texas? And it's like a scam. The building. The empty. Like the blue prince he submitted. They were like inches instead of feet. So what was supposed to be like a 90-story building is a three-story building. What? That's the gist of it. It's like this weird looking skyscraper. The guy submitted plans to a developer and just instead of did the one tick instead of two ticks for inches instead of feet. And then built this tiny building for way over price and dip town with the rest of the money. That's what the cyber track is going to be. Elon's going to hand out a bunch of matchbox hot wheels, size cars. Wait, why don't we think we are seeing a lot of them now? Yeah, we see. Yeah, there's no more truth in and out. Yeah, in the world of auto blogs and spy shots. There's a really high level of... There's a bunch of spy shots of the new Porsche 911, which people suggest that they're going to make a hybrid 911 as their next flagship sports car. And there's been a handful of them spotted at the N\\u00fcrburgring. And all the articles I'm reading are like, this is going to launch in 2023. I'm like, what? There's... Okay, that seems like a really fast turnaround. Which is like they're testing a like a spy-kitted camouflage version of it now. And by the time they ship it in three, four months, they'll be finished testing. It'll be good to go. And that seems to have a super high degree of confidence. Why isn't cyber trucking that? Because it's Tesla. I don't think they're going to... I agree. They're going to build up the hype even more. I don't think even if it's ready, they're not going to release it. You think this is more of a marketing? Yes. And I think I don't think it'll be ready to go maybe early next year if that's the case. But I don't think they're going to be like, we got it. Okay, good. Ship. It might even be an opportunity for people to pre-order more. Like Elon to be like, yeah, just like they're like, oh, if we just put them in the wild, people will think maybe it's actually going to come out soon. And so people get back on and pre-order so they can lock in their pricing or whatever. That's a good angle. I like that possibility. It's definitely like... I don't think we saw this much public testing with any previous Tesla because Model 3 was kind of a surprise development. And Model S gets a refresh once in a bloom. Yeah. So it's like this is a unique instance where they could totally just use it for marketing. Yeah. But yeah, I don't know. So between that and the Roadster. Roadster, I've just given up hope. I think they just never started developing that again. I'm not going to say never. I think there's a drawing on a meeting room whiteboard somewhere. And I think that counts as development. Okay. That's about it. I think we'll see... We'll see to prove me wrong, bro. We'll see the little quad that they drove into the Cybertruck before we see the road. Because the quad that is a hot paint. That is a hot paint. The Cybert Quad or whatever. The Cybert Quad definitely doesn't come out. That's funny. Okay. I think that's a good bet. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, it's like I think this whole NACS thing, insanely good for Tesla because they basically get to become the gas station. Like it's kind of a small... It's a very smart play to have the best infrastructure and then release a car. And then everyone buys the that car because they're the only ones with the good infrastructure. But once you've saturated the market enough, where so many people have Tesla's that it's such a household name, they're bigger than every other car company by far. Then you can be like, okay, we've sold... We're still going to sell cars. But we've kind of like... We're sort of plateauing a little bit. So then switch over to becoming the gas pump. Because now you can like... Even with the magic dock. You know, you have the Tesla app. You can pay Tesla for energy. Tons of people have been wanting to use that networking. Now you just have a price tag and you just let it loose. And then now they get the licensing from NACS, which is going to be basically the standard. They get the gas, the electricity money from like everyone that's charging from... Like they're going to beat... That company is going to the moon. They finally have money. Yeah. Yeah. They can develop like a sports car. Or something. That'd be cool. Like one that they showed off seven years ago? Yeah, 2017. God, that's thinking. I don't want to think about it. I don't want to think about it. It's never happening. Okay. Well, we can end it at that. I think that's probably a good bet. I don't know if we have any stakes for this bet. But I'm the only one on my side of it. So let's not make it too crazy. Yeah, you're... You stand alone. And with that, let's do trivia. Let's finish it up. I have two whiteboards because I have Andrews. I've got one over here. Oh, I need one of those markers. You have one over there. Actually, give me the other one. I'll give you a marker for a whiteboard. Okay. While they get their whiteboards out, Adam and I have an important trivia announcement to make. And that is, we need your help. We have a very exciting trivia special coming out in the next few weeks. But before we can make that episode, we need to know how you feel about tech stuff. So if you go on the Waveform Twitter, if you go in our Discord, the Waveform channel in the MKBHD Discord, you'll see a link to a Google form. Fill it out. If you have a few minutes, it doesn't take that much time at all. It's pretty simple questions. But it will make our next trivia episode even more fun. Can we reveal smarts, but also a lot of data? Can we reveal the format? I think that would be fun. We can reveal the format. I don't know how to do it because John O was like, you can't use the word. We're not going to get sued. All right. Without using the words, do you guys know that game show where Steve the guy with the mustache points out the board and goes, we asked 100 people what they think of this survey says? Yeah. So we're going to do something like that. We just need those people to say the things about tech. We asked 100, and we asked, it's honestly going to be thousands of MKBHD fans. Survey or We can say survey says. Probably. Where are they going to get sued? Y'all. Survey says. Yeah. Mustache man knows people. Yeah. I also want to say how many priority clips have I shown anywhere? I was, I don't remember where I was yesterday. I was somewhere. I was in a restaurant. And Family Feud was playing on the big TV. And for like the four minutes that I was watching, oh wait, not Family Feud. No, no, Family Fight. That's just different. That's the Family Fight is the one in. It's always sunny. Anyway, sorry to keep talking. Yeah, so I was playing on that TV. And I didn't see anyone guessing questions or anything. It was just Steve Harvey dancing with one of the people from one of the families. People love his outtakes. The entire time they were just like dancing. That's the beauty of Steve Harvey as a game show host. Is when he needs to, he can just be like a hawk about the rules. And it'd be like, we're here to play the game. And then other times he's just like messing around. This is my show and I'm going to use my 30 minutes how I want. Yeah. Anyway, it was honestly, he's a game show my show. As a producer of this show, I look up to Steve Harvey immensely. And the team. And it's the team that way. Hopefully, yeah. If you're a lawyer from TVS, please don't come after us. Okay, CBS. TVS. ABC. ShmeBS. Anyway, it's going to be fun. If you answer the questionnaire, there's a link on Twitter. It will be on our discord as well. Show notes. But yeah, so that way we can go like survey says. And then we have like a lot of data, a lot of smarts and also a lot of data. That bell sound for sure. All right. So score of this trivia round. Oh boy. So far, Marquez has 19. Andrew has 18. David. In the lead with 23. Oh, Jesus. Damn. Go, baby. So like a game show to catch up. First question. Twitch is wildly popular for gaming streamers. True. YouTube gaming was launched in 2015. But when was it discontinued and imported into regular YouTube? You will get one point for the year, another point for the month. I do not look confident, Marquez. My trainer thought is. I have a great a free train, meaning it's very slow to get started. But once it's going, I can't really change it. And boys are full of good stuff. Yeah, hopefully it doesn't catch fire. The interrupts traffic everywhere. Spells can chemicals everywhere. Okay, we both said 2017. What was it? 2017. Okay, I said March. I said January. All right. Wow. Great. Oh, it was 2016. It was 2018. It lasted. Yeah, I was surprised. I thought it was September 2018. I almost guessed 2019. I wouldn't have gotten either. I'll ask Andrew later and we'll cut him in here. That's it. You got your answer? Yeah, like so. Flip it and read. 2018. What's correct? For one extra point, do you know the month? August. September. So close. But you got a point next year. Let's go. Three years for a Google product that is pointless is pretty good. Like the Google products that are good usually less at least one more year. Yeah. Anyway, all right. Question number two, WWDC wasn't always called WWDC. It's going to be the weird answer, isn't it? Before that. I'm just writing Geico now. Was it called? A, the Macintosh developers world gathering, MDWG, B, Apple Independent Software Developers Conference, the AISDC, C, the Santa Clara Developers Symposium, SCDS, or D, the Global Electronic and Information Coaters Open House. Geico. Open House. It's one of the two. I think I'm pretty. I'm pretty. When you're making a trivia question, does anyone ever make A the answer? It's kind of like when you're answering multiple tries on a quiz. Like is it ever used by a rule always say like C or B? Yeah. Or D. A, S, A, T, is there? The answer to their A or B unless I'm wrong. So. All right. I said A. B. I said MDWG, which is A, I think. No. It's B. I don't remember what that was, but it's B. Correct. Two points. Two for two. Was the first one where you trying to mess me up with MDW? Yes. Good. Well, this was Alex's question. So one, we wanted to mess you up. And two, I don't know if you noticed, but D spells out Geico. Oh, it did not notice that. It's the, it's like Apple or like Mac related things. So I figured I wanted to keep with that, but the first one being MDW. New Jersey's called Memorial Day Weekend MDW. Oh, I did not know that. I figured then like July 4th. I feel like in Jersey, but that's what I was like, that's a joke. I think it's a joke, but not intended, but sure. Let's go. You know, it was worth getting my entire vacation cancelled and ruined for me to come in and go two for two on trivia this week. So take the lead against Mark. Hopefully the rest of the episode was good without me, but you know, come in clutch here when I can. It's a B. It was B. The Apple Independent Software Developers Con. I know it. Sorry. God, I almost wrote that. I cannot believe you guys didn't pick Geico. That's I wanted to. I wrote it first, but I crossed it out. When Adam and I wrote this question, we decided Geico should be an answer and then spent so much time with the source. Trying to make it work. What was B again? It was the Apple Independent Software Developers Con. That's actually, okay, that makes more sense. My reasoning was that at the time that this started, Mac was probably the only thing you could develop for applications for, but because like the, I mean, on the iPod, you couldn't make applications for the iPod. Well, this was also in 1983. Yeah. It was the first one. There wasn't an iPhone. Only the Mac was out. Oh, I see. That's why I thought it was. The Mac came out in 1984. Because it had the famous commercial, 1984 won't be like, I think. No, that was that was that wasn't the first Mac though. They had like the Lisa. They made the 19. But the Lisa is not a Mac. It's the Lisa. Oh, good point. Did they not even have the Mac name? That's interesting. I'm pretty sure the Lisa came out in 1983. It was pretty sure that the 84 Apple release was like the Mac. What products did they have that you could develop for at that time? They had the Lisa. They had the Apple 2. They had. So I shouldn't have put Mac in the name, of course. Because I was thinking like, if you wanted to scale for an X period of time, you need to have an ambiguous enough that it's just like we are developing things. Not it's connected to a product. So I shouldn't have said A, but I've. But we did. Anyway, I did. That's the thing we did. That's okay. Maintain my lead, but just not be even more maintaining it. You know, that's okay. I don't think Andrew's going to get that one. I'm fine. I'm okay. Anyway, anyway, we'll run those by Andrew and see if he gets them right. But until the next episode, thanks for watching. And we'll catch you the next one. Peace. Peace. Weightform is a. Open was produced by Adam. Wait, wait, wait. That's how it starts, right? Okay. Weightform is pretty. Weightform is produced by Adam Alita and Ellis Roven. We are partnered with the box media podcast network and our intro after music. Is that not what it is? It's a part of the box media. Weightform is produced by Ellis Roven and Adam Alina. That's what we are part of the. It's Adam Alina Ellis Roven. We're from is produced by Adam Alina and Ellis Roven. We are part of the box media podcast network network. New work. Interesting. I don't know. Weightform is produced by Adam. Weightform? Ah! This is this. Throw them. Yeah, I can't point. Weightform is produced by Adam Alina and Ellis Roven. We are part of the box media podcast network and our intro outro music is created by Vain Soe. Great. Weight is created in it or is it just by? I say it enough.\"": -0.02915404550731182, "\" Alright, what is up, people of the internet. Welcome back to another episode of the Wayform podcast. Rehose, I'm Arquez, I'm Andrew, and I'm David. And we've compiled, we've been taking notes this whole week about what we wanted to talk about, and it's turned out this is mostly a social media episode. We have a lot to say about a lot of different social networks. Starting with Google+, of course, is the hottest one, just kidding. YouTube, fighting some things, Twitter, fighting some things, Reddit fighting some things, Instagram fighting some things. But first, we want to talk about the Zenphone. You've been actually using the Zenphone alongside. I have been telling that. I can officially say so I've been using this for about two weeks now. I want to preface this by saying, also, this is the first non-pixel phone I've used since the Pixel 3. The 3 is when I switched to the Pixel lineup, and I've only used Pixel since then. So this is a fairly close to stock Android phone. Yes. How have you been finding the Zenphone 10? I will start it by saying I really appreciate, oh, you have all the fun colors. I was just showing the colors. What, five colors this time? Yeah, five colors. Blue, white, black, green, red. Yes. Blue is hot. Blue is hot. And by hot, I mean, really subtle. It's really cool actually. Yeah. It is really quite bright. That's warm. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. The green is like a bright, pine green. Yeah. I've been using the green. I think we kind of were wondering if which one is going to fade the worst because remember the Zenphone 9 had like a terrible fading. I do think this back material is going to not fade as bad. They said they made the material better from last year, right? Yes. Yeah. Actually, I'll just said that. Yeah. So I'll start by just my like summary of the phone, which is I love the Zenphone 9 shamelessly. Like just one of my favorite phones ever. It won my small phone of the year last year. And I could only really come up with maybe two nitpicks about that phone. One is it didn't have wireless charging. They added it to this phone. So it's got 30 watt, 30 watt wired, 15 watt wireless boom. They did that. Epic. The other nitpick was the back material just like faded so hard. I had a red phone within a month. Keep in mind you own a phone for years. Within a month, my phone was like dark and used looking like really. Yeah. I'm like a year, two years, three years. This phone is going to look crazy. I mean, it probably bottoms off after a while. But that was that was a legitimate pick I had. This phone still feels kind of the same like it's a soft punch. It's got a little texture to it, but they told me it's a different material. So I said, Oh, okay, it's a different material. It hopefully is a better aging, more durable material. And so far, that's felt like it's held up to be true as well. So I no longer have anything negative to say at all about this phone. It's great. It just has like the tiniest littleest nitpicks for me. Yeah. It's phone is incredible. I mean, that's kind of how I feel. I those two things I agree with, I said the wireless charging was a deal breaker for me. And I was like, man, if this had wireless charging, how would you use it? And here we are. I'm using it. And I do agree. I've, I mean, I take this to the climbing gym and catch charcoal over it. I throw it on the ground. I've seen very little wear on the back of it. And the greens really light. So I feel like it could show where very easily. I was hoping I had it with me on, you know, some hiking over the last week, but I didn't. So I didn't get to see if it got that dirty from there. Those of you out of the loop, Andrew, I said was on vacation when we recorded last week, but then his flight got canceled. And now it's a different. It was terrible. So he's back. He's back. We're rescheduling it. But we're back. I'm happy to be here. And, but yeah, so so far, like you said, I've loved it. It has wireless charging. The size I'm getting used to because I'm not used to something small, which I think let's take a minute. We were arguing about this beforehand. What did you say? Someone said on YouTube. But what? So there were a lot of comments. I don't know if it was from your tweet when it would got announced or something. But a lot of people are saying, like, this is a misconception. This is not a small phone. We are talking about relative to any other, mostly phone, any other Android phone you can get right now. It's like one of the smallest ones, specifically with flagship specs. It is definitively. I'm pretty sure I can say it's definitively the smallest phone with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Yeah. And it is definitely the smallest flagship phone you can get. Yeah. The iPhone SE is technically slightly smaller. Yeah. But that's not a flagship phone. As someone who's used a lot of phones to like, when I type on this phone, the keyboard feels a little bit small sometimes. Do you have it? Wait, wait. Before we go forward, I also think one of the complaints of that though was comparing it to the iPhone mini. When it is closer, it is closer to the size of a regular iPhone than the iPhone mini, but it was being compared to that just because it is one of the smaller Android devices. Yeah. iPhone is a smaller iOS device. The iPhone mini, that's what the older made. Yes. When it was out, it was by a landslide, the smallest flagship phone you could get. Yeah. Currently, it is small. Is what we're trying to say? It is a small phone. It is my front runner for smallest, best small phone of the year again right now. Do you think this would be a front runner for just overall best phone of the year? So here's what gets interesting. Or best value. So I think yes, for best value. Six, ninety nine, right? Yes. The same price last year. Awesome. Awesome value. Literally incredible battery life. Yeah. Really good cameras. I think in order to be like an overall MVP best phone, it's a little more blurry. I think you could argue on impact or on overall sentiment about a phone. Yes, it's right there. But I would also want slightly better cameras. I would want. You know, like I think the cameras are good. But I think there be plus to a minus good where the absolute cream of the crop, the S23 ultra is the ones that have a telephoto camera, the iPhone 14 Pros, the Pixel Pro. Those are going to be a bit better. I mean, it doesn't have a telephoto. I think that's just one thing it's lacking and it's a small phone and that would be a lot of room to take up. But it's not like a flagship camera system. It's right underneath one. So it's not going to be the best phone of the year, but it is good at everything it does. Yeah. Also as a headphone jack. I just want to do a quick rundown of like what's inside this phone, right? Yeah. Snapdragon HN2 wireless charging. It's 5.9 inches, 144 hertz, IP68, headphone jack, 30 watt charging, like very durable. It's got basically everything that anyone ever asked for. And the fact that the battery life is so good when it takes no sense. So I'll say for my battery life, it's the middle of the day. I'm at 47%. That's because I haven't charged it since yesterday. It's incredible. It's really. I'm a day and half in it almost half that. You said 144 hertz. I will mention it is almost never 144 hertz. Okay. So you can put it at auto and it will go up to 144 hertz only when game genie has told it that it is playing a game that can take advantage of a hundred twenty four. Not even on like the home screen. Not only. Yeah. It's 120 all the time. Well, I don't care. So it's just like they get to say 144 on the press materials, but it's 120. I mean, 120 is perfectly fine. That's a great photo. This is low light at Coney Island the other. That's a really good picture or low light photo. Yeah. I was very impressed. I've always really liked Asus' cameras. Even when I did like the Zenfone 5 or 6 review way back in the day, they don't lean super hard into like computational photography HDR stuff, which I think is a strong suit for them. Because it gives them a little more contrast or a little sharper. There's less noise reduction. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're they do well in the test every year as well. Yeah. It is potentially one of the top four or five phones in this blind or get like gets knocked out by the winner and puts up a fight against it, which is I think a lot of people would argue like, Oh, so okay, why is it not one of the best flagship cameras? It still has to compete with ultra wide slasking compete with telephoto. So it has to compete with video. It does have it has no telephoto. It does have really, really great stabilization. Right. Which should be obvious if you look at the giant camera module almost to the point where it's like it's like too finicky about being like, no, no, you weren't perfectly still. Maybe you should take that picture again and I'll look at it and be like, no, it's totally fine. But now I'm worried about it. I remember I just remember walking around just taking like handheld video, just like normal not thinking too hard about it. And I played it one played it back. It was just like normal 4K 30, not even the Super smooth mode. And it was just remarkably smooth. And I was like, this is as good as I'd want it. It's really good. Yeah. Six nine and I still am like, how did they get the 699 price point? That's crazy. So it's not going to sell well. This is my thing is like, and actually Aaron, he made a video where most of his video was about how this phone won't sell well. And I kind of tend to agree. But I am so happy that ASUSS continued to spend on and make money or to make the effort to make this phone good and small. Because it takes extra work and extra engineering to fit it in a small space and still make it so good. And it's going to be in the US this year. They're actually going to launch a quarter three. That's epic. Which is cool. I don't know if it's going to be in a bunch of carrier stores or maybe just one or two. That would be nice. But yeah, it's it's not going to over sell the big screen. Because what do people like buying big screen? Big screen. So yeah, I don't know. Claire's using an S10E and she was like, I want this as my next phone. S10E is a really good parallel because this also has the fingerprint reader power button. It really is. Oh my god. This is the S10E. Yeah, stays with the headphone jack. Yeah. S10E also have the corner. Whole punch. Remember the big hero six wallpaper we use. That's a good parallel. Yeah. But overall, love it. It's getting I took me a little while to get used to a smaller phone because I've always used bigger ones. My tiny gripes are the fingerprint sensor I missed under the screen just because when I grab it with my left hand, even though I've used my pointer finger as a phone, you can use but you can only launch apps in it in floating windows, which I just like let me open a full full screen app from that because I like to it's like a quick it's like a one-handed mode. Yeah, it's like the quick actions from the side and you can either do like settings toggles on it or also apps, but they're only. So then you have to open it and then like click the big button because I hate using windowed apps on a phone. Got it. It's just not my on an already small phone. I don't know. Maybe the idea is that it's sort of like our career like opening a window temporarily and then you're closing it quickly. Exactly. I think like the best version would be like you're you have an app already and you're like I need to throw the calculator app up and do it really quick and then like click out of there. That's kind of cool. That makes sense. It's a cool idea. I just don't. Yeah. If it was full screen, that seems like a really simple addition. The kadoo would be awesome to be able to do that every time. We like toggles. At toggles. What was the pixel fold thing? It's the same thing. Give me the option to have a separately out on the inside and outside just to just to toggle. Yeah, just that doesn't have to be on by default. Just let me toggle it. Yeah. Yeah. We like Android because it's customizable like. Same as simple. We like toggles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Morrow's. All right. Moving on. YouTube is testing blocking a video entirely if you have an ad blocker installed. I wouldn't run about. This is the thing about these headlines is whenever I see a headline that says YouTube is testing, yeah. I kind of just wait because YouTube tests a lot of crazy things. Yeah. A lot of some things do make it. YouTube was testing or moving a dislike counter and it made it to the top and they disliked it. YouTube was testing, you know, some other weird things that eventually made it to the top. But YouTube also tests like insane things that they just want to see if it'll work with like a fraction of a percent of people. And then it goes away. So I don't know how far in the testing process this one has made it. It seems like it's still not fully rolled out. But yeah, you know, social media companies like to protect the way they make money. So I mean, you have an ad blocker. You're not making them any money. That's the thing. How many things do they test that are directly affecting their bottom line? Like YouTube offers an insane amount of stuff with free video uploads and essentially unlimited space for anybody. So like they need to make money. And I'm not going to sit here and like totally defend YouTube. They have plenty of money. But it's their whole business. Exactly. I would be pretty surprised if this doesn't push forward. Yeah. Yeah. I will also say, I've had YouTube premium for so long that I forgot their ads on YouTube. I was guilty of that for a while to you. And I know that for one person, it's kind of expensive. But you can have up to six people in your Google family plan. And it's only like $3.80 a month per person if you have all sex people in your family. It's funny how we think about these prices. It's only $3.80 for no ads on an unlimited video supply of the entire internet. You don't have to go to college for $3.80. That's it. You one person has to pay and everyone pays them back. Yeah. Just checking. Yeah. It's the smart way of doing it. Yeah. For YouTube. You didn't just hear that. No. No. We are we are family. We are family to describe how it it seems like they're testing it though. Essentially, if you were to try and play a video with an ad blocker on rather than immediately just block videos entirely, it they give you like three chances with a screen that says like they designed a whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. Because they want to like push people towards like why they're doing this. And it says it looks like you may be using an ad blocker. Playback will be blocked unless YouTube is allowed on the is disabled on the ad blocker list or you can use YouTube premium. So trying to push it towards that also with a like creator still get paid from your subscription. So more along the lines of like help your creator friends. Yeah. Yeah. This is exact. Yeah. But also us. Yeah. I will say like it felt like the earlier internet we everyone was like add suck like get away from ads like get them you know use ad blockers. Well, I think people are a little more open to like seeing ads because we kind of zone them out a little bit more now like even banner ads on websites like I don't even really notice anymore. And then like YouTube video. The thing with YouTube video ads though is I was so used to not seeing them for so long. And then sometimes I go into incognito mode to watch YouTube video because I don't want it to have a lot of ads. Yeah. At the beginning double ads at the beginning they're both 30 seconds. I'm like yeah. So there's like a three minute video and I'm watching one minute of ads. Yeah. I more and more of how the internet is working is without paid creators. Those ads is like you're not getting the people creating those. So like if it was going to meta I would like block the ads. But if it's going to creators I'm like yeah. It's going to creators or like if you think of your favorite tech blog like nine to five Mac or a bird or something like that. It's like I'm going to put those on my like I use an ad block but I also use the the white list feature very like cognizantly of like making sure that the people I want to keep reading are white listed from that so they make money and I can keep reading because so many places are shutting down now because they're losing money and I'm sure a lot of those places are scared of these AI things taking all their information. Yeah. And this is this is even beyond just online video like we just saw a whole bunch of ESPN layoffs. How many ads do you see on ESPN? Like when you watch TV aren't there like four consecutive minutes of ads or something like that for every 10 minutes to TV something crazy yeah. And they're still like yeah we're out of money for you sorry. I know that like SpongeBob episodes they have two episodes or they've won episode and fit within a 15 minute block but then like four or five minutes of that is ads. So a SpongeBob episode is actually like 11 minutes long. Wow. I think that's like the most television. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of episodes. Yeah. It's crazy. Like when you watch a 30 minute TV episode you only watch to 21 minute. Yeah. And most of like a lot of ads. Yeah. I feel so old that we're explaining how commercials and SpongeBob was as kids like and that kids there are people out listening to this that don't understand. Yeah. So for those of you who don't know there's a thing called linear television where you don't get to choose where you are in the video ever it's just playing non-stop and you don't get to hit pause. Well I guess maybe you could which is what like Pluto TV is now. But then unscrupible ads would just play back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to basketball ads. Yeah. Then you just call that. Commercial break. That's what it's called. Yeah. It's like when we go to break but we don't really have commercials. Well sometimes we do I guess. Well speaking of breaks let's take a quick ad break. Wow. And then we'll come back and we'll talk more about social media. But of course we have this little fun thing that we do for ad breaks which is trivia. Trivia. It's way better than SpongeBob. Here you're minus the score. The score. Andrew is wondering. Andrew got a lot of play plans to make. He wants to press that. There you go. Mark has 19 David with 23. Andrew with 20. 20 club. Rude. This is gonna be rough. I lose both the names. I put that for later. Mark has I wouldn't have done that high five if I had known that he was just trying to put you in the 24. All right first question. So what was the first commercially available smartphone with wireless charging? Seeing as the Zenfone 10 now has wireless charging. What was the first one?

Rosemary's restrictions apply. All right, welcome back. So I have a question and David, I promise this will make sense in a minute, but it might be confusing right now. Marquez. Like a free agency happened. It did last week. It popped off. Any where there any like cool fun things, big trades, blockbuster trades, like interest, finding hard to follow at all. Inter is literally being like, David, I know you don't know sport, but it will make sense. It will roll into something we all understand. Do you know when Gretzky was the other day? I'm not going to ask you paid attention to free agency. Continue. That's fair. Yeah. No, there's some good trade. I'm just saying I'm a little hurt. Chris Paul got waved and he was a he was technically a Washington wizard. Yeah, a few days. And now he's a he's on the warriors, which is fascinating because he was like their biggest, not biggest. You're a big Chris Paul fan. Yeah, he was the rival and I was going to play for them. So your warriors now? Well, I'll keep watching them play. It's tough being a West Coast, sorry, I'm tangling already. West Coast basketball fan because all the games start at 10, 10, 30 games. Yeah, I'm going better like 2 a.m. Yeah, I want to watch some East Coast teams this year, but yeah, there were some moves. Have you heard of the next? The New York Knicks. Yeah, I've heard of them. We did make a good signing though. Did you? Yeah. I would even need a chance. I don't even chance. I think he's going to run your whole team. No, no, no, no, no, but we got the like core crew now from the villain, yeah, from the villain, no, but team that won. So like, I like it. It's fun. It's going to keep winning naturally. So question. When you're following free agency, how do you follow Alex? Alex. Shout out to Lockdown Dixie. Yeah, Alex is honestly. It's usually Twitter or or all open Instagram and it'll refresh and they'll be a Rose post at the top. Oh, yeah, Rose is like it was funny. He, I sorry. So there's this guy. It's not a real thing. Adrian, Rose, I don't know. I'm going to butcher's name. What is it? What is it? He's a crazy reporter that he knows things before the players. So he tweeted out like a week ago about one player that was like not getting their contract extended or something like that. And that player was like, thanks for the heads up. I had no idea. Oh, man. Yeah. So he knows things. He's the same way. Well, so the reason you might be wondering why we're talking about this. Yes. To me, the two best ways to follow free agency, I'm an NHL fan, not an NBA fan, but they they're like exact similar. Yeah. This all happens on July 1st. And I follow all of it through Reddit and Twitter, which July 1st, Reddit and Twitter, were very hard to follow on. Oh, because Reddit lost all third party apps on July 1st. They all closed down. And Twitter had a fun little rate limit feature. Whatever you want to call it. They started the day of July 1st for both of them. So I would like to talk about both of these and how annoying they were. Where do we start? Yeah. Which would you like to talk about first? Twitter Reddit. First, I would like to say I do not know sports. But I think that we should talk about Reddit first for no reason. I agree with that reason. Cool. We talked brief. Well, we talked to in length about. Yes. What Reddit is doing. Yeah. In the previous episode. Yeah. The update is that now they've gone through with actually new. We got to the limit. So when they had to pay the bill, right? Yes. They didn't nuke. So they turned on the API cost thing. Not all third party apps shut down. No. I believe bacon reader is still around and said they are switching to a paid only option very soon. Or that was that relay for Reddit. I'm still using a relay and I've had no updates. Okay. Relay is still like on the fence. But I think the most recently thing I saw about them is that they're like, it's probably going to cost about $7 a month, which might mean just shut down because that's expensive to ask for. Yeah. I think we would probably pay that much. Yeah. I would probably not want to pay more than five. But I would. Seven's a lot of money. Seven's a lot of money per month. But if you think about what has to go through Play Store and App Store and by the time they make it back to pay for these stupid API changes, they're not totally sure yet. But Apollo, Sync and Reddit is fun. All shut down. They were gone end of June 30th over with. And I just had to say because of free agency, I had to use the default app for a little bit. And I previously had mentioned that it's very bad. And now after using it for a weekend, I think I need to make a small correction on that. It's really bad. It is so much worse than I thought it was. It is horrible. It is the worst experience. I think I've ever dealt with it. It's pretty bad. And app, I just like, have you used the default app? I have managed to avoid it so far. Yeah. Almost goodness. Look at scrolling through this. I'm in dark mode. Okay. I'm also in airplane mode. So that might take a second. It's not letting any of you. I also want to make it. I want to make it a quick correction that bacon reader did fully shut down. But did it relay for Reddit is still around for now. But they will be moving to a subscription model in the coming weeks. I'm so underkeeping it. The developer is trying to get there. The API calls that they're using. It's down as low as possible. So they can charge as little as possible. Yeah. But we'll find out soon. How much that actually is. I've got a couple updates in the Play Store. And every time I see an update for really Reddit, I'm like, oh no, what is it? I looked out. I load up the notes. And it just says API optimization. So I'm like, oh, okay. Wow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it still works. Yeah. So this is I just loaded up the hockey subreddit. It has a pin post at the top. Look at in dark mode. You like can't even tell where a new post starts. Yeah. Do you see how bad this looks? Then a potential full page ad. Wasn't ad. This is an ad. Oh, full page. I was a full page video ad. And then just like these terrible. It's just everything. Look. That's a full page video ad. Yeah. I mean, I'm not logged in, which I think would still be people. How many ads there are? It's horrible. Is it just been my normal Reddit experience? Well, it sounds like that's probably why you don't like Reddit very much. If you're on Android, use Relay for Reddit, it's in my opinion one of the best Reddit apps that's ever been made. And it's free. It's still free for now. So for now, weirdly enough, oh, it's free for now. I was using a relay pro, I guess. Yeah. Because I paid for it. Yeah, it's still free for now, but they're going to be moving to a subscription model. They've announced the price yet. But they must be doing pretty well if they can take that time because they're going to charge. They're starting to. Yeah, I paid for Relay pro, but it was a one-time fee. So yeah, same. Yeah, a couple books. It was $3. And then I think there's still $3.7 years ago. Yeah. Switch over. The scary part about all of this though is that like the more people that go over to these apps that didn't have as big of a user base before, the more it's going to cost them. Jump in and then more like it might just don't use real. Also, it's awful. It's awful. What are you saying? It's awful. Weirdly enough, Claire has read it as fun on her phone and it still works. I read. I don't know how. I read something that like there was some weird setting that Reddit has fun still works for for some reason. But it's going to get patch soon. It's going to get destroyed soon. I'm sure. Well, she was, she told me she's like, I've been using Reddit. I was like, no, you haven't. And she's like, no, no, I'm fine. He's like, you just haven't refreshed it yet. Like you probably, it's just old stuff. Then she refreshes it right in front of me. I was like, can I borrow this for a minute? I've got to get my fix in. So right now, pretty much what I'm doing is I have the default app if I want to like really look at something. But because I'm not logged in in the default app for me to go try and read comments on Reddit is like, a chore. So I don't find myself like freely scrolling through it anymore. Okay. So it logs you out, but it still works. So it just Claire. So yeah, apparently she doesn't log in to any. Apparently it's read it as fun. Currently is like basically just accessing the old dot Reddit like public website and using that data somehow. Yeah. It says most likely using the dot json API, which is still available anonymously. So you can't, you can't be logged in and use it. Which is annoying. So it's basically just like a different interface to read the website. I guess. With it being logged in. If you're poinlin, like if you're trying to go to a certain subreddit, I guess that still would work. Okay. Because then you can just you have to search every time to be friends. This is as of four days ago. So maybe Reddit patched it and yeah, now they're shut down. So it'll probably be on there. But I mean like ultimately. Yeah, yeah, following me to see your NFL free agency on Reddit would have been pretty tough. This is like impossible. But then there's Twitter. But then there's Twitter. There's Twitter. Which is great. All right. So the Twitter thing that happened was on July 1st, a lot of people might have seen this little notification pop up that says rate limit exceeded. And did any of you guys get it? I did. Not. But I did it. The first thing when I woke up in the morning, I opened Twitter and I saw it. I think it's within like 24 hours or whatever. So I probably hit it till day before and then it went into effect. Great notification prompt for people that have no idea what that means. Great job, Elon. But basically they set this limit so that you can only read a certain number of posts. And they also for some reason made it so it was a different amount for Twitter blue users. It was 10 times the the amount for Twitter blue users. It started as 600 for non blue users and 6000 for blue users. They are increasing it more and more over time. Elon said it was temporary. We'll see if it's temporary. Yeah. They also didn't tell anyone to 1 p.m. Eastern like the whole morning and like like I said, this is NBA and NHL free agency. There were like some of the biggest reporters that I follow trying to see stuff. They're just like, well, I guess you can look at all this on my my space page because like this is not working. And those people need to scour the internet to look for breaking news. And Twitter is supposed to be the site of breaking news. And now you're living in. I think that the reason that they turn this on was that they are trying to figure out what AI companies are scraping Twitter without using the paid API because you can do that without using the paid API using scraping services. And technically, it'll just like run through tweets really rapidly. So you'll hit a wall really quickly. Whether or not they actually like make it a temporary thing or if they just have it for a very long period of time because they need to keep catching these companies. I have no idea. Yeah. That does a similar excuse to what Steve often said. It is. Which I think that's a like I didn't get to the legitimate excuse. Agreed. Yeah. But it sucks that like this new era of technology is coming in and it's basically completely destroying all the other stuff. Yeah. It's destroying a lot of other users. I'm sure Woj hit his hit his rate limit for the day. Well, the thing about Woj is he's he's on the phone. He's getting his info and then he's just tweeting it. And so everyone who's trying to follow and refresh and find the latest stuff will hit their limits probably if they're not logged in or whatever. But yeah, that's it is it's kind of like we constantly see Google and YouTube like fighting their demons of like people trying to take advantage of this site in Twitter's case. It's people scraping or AI services scraping in YouTube's case a lot of times it's spammers and scammers and things like that people making fake accounts. So I could imagine like the brute force version of this on YouTube would be like you left too many YouTube comments rate limit exceeded and you're like what what do you mean rate limit exceeded I like going around and leaving comments on things. Yeah, it's like well spammers just go around and leave thousands of comments on things. So if we just set a hard cap before we think about it at all that's at least a way to stop scammers from being so effective. Yeah. And this is Twitter's version of that. It's like wow people are going around scraping all of Twitter pulling thousands of things off the site and whatever they're doing with it we're not getting paid. Yeah. So we'll just set a hard limit and that's temporary. We'll figure out a better way to do something else about it later in the future. But for now some regular users are going to hit that limit too and oh well. Also all the tech vcs have all been like if you're hitting the rate limit then you need to go outside and touch grass. That was and the funny thing about that is like bro you own this app like the point you are clearly just using that as an excuse because you're you're trying to make us use the app as much as possible. So you can't just like turn around it is kind of funny that people want us to use the app. My app is too toxic for you. So you should go outside like all right. I feel like like Elons was like we're not going to tell anyone and they're going to just think Twitter broke. Yeah. Then at one o'clock I'm going to tell people it's a very small number and then everyone's going to complain and then an hour later I'm going to be like well hold up we'll increase it and then another hour later is like okay we'll increase it more and then right after that is like touch grass losers and she's like what is going on how is this the PR cycle of Twitter? That's the Elon cycle. That's pretty much consistent with everything that's ever happened negatively to him. Interesting. Yeah. It's just though I don't know. I can't believe you don't announce it at first because everyone was very confused. They just thought Twitter was going down. Like they thought it was one of those days where Twitter was just not going to quite work. It's a funny thing because some of these it's funny that this coincidence it's like the how do I say this? YouTube also never tells anyone about the changes that it makes to stops bammers and scammers. All the hour and make changes it's a black box. All the rule changes about things like that that you can't do with an account that you just made. When we made a brand new account for this podcast we tried to upload and it took like 24 hours to process. I'm sure that's another rule we don't know about but the reason they never announced those rules is so that those spammers and scammers cannot read the rulebook and go how do I get around this? Because that's a guidebook for how you get around all those rules. Yeah. But it's a weird coincidence that with Twitter this limit also coincided with regular users use where like a regular user could just be reading tweets and then hit the limit. We're like most of the things with YouTube it's like you can't leave 300 comments in an hour. Yeah. Okay well if you did you'd think YouTube broke. Reddit couldn't leave any more comments. Yeah most regular people are never going to do that. Reddit has had that built in since like the beginning. Like you can't leave like more than like three comments within like 10 minutes or something. Yeah. Or it goes oh that's kind of spammer make more than that may post with 10 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah I'm sure you can't you know change your profile picture 10 times in 10 minutes. I'm sure there's a lot of things we don't know that you can't do on YouTube and Twitter. It's just this one happens to be something that regular people are like wait what I hit the limit what I'm just acting normal what's going on. Yeah when you do views on a thing that's just you're scrolling through hundreds and hundreds of like posts in comments like going through one post in their comments like you're hitting 100. When somebody gets traded I scroll through all the reaction tweets so fast there's like hundreds of games about the guy that gets just got traded it's yeah it's pretty easy. I haven't hit the limit yet but I imagine it's not that I hate it. Although you're verified I'm verified so 600 like when it first happened 600 posts you're kidding I'm not even out of bed. I'm I'm through a thousand posts before I even step my feet on the floor. Touch grass. Touch grass. Yeah. Yeah that was just it was a hectic day and it happened on a day where like Twitter and Reddit were very important I was very sad and you know I really feel like both of these has just turned into me using them far less on my phone which probably is a good thing. It's actually yeah it's probably old. It's not really good. Touching grass. It's terrible for them to make money but it's yeah the ultimate goal of all these social media companies is to make as much money as possible basically I'm so simplifying but like they want to make as much money as possible and if the mechanic of them making money is you spend more time on the site so you see more ads. Yeah. Then anything they do that's counter to that seems hilariously dumb. Yeah. So this seems pretty stupid. You're getting people to leave the site faster thus making less money. Yeah. They'll figure it out. Also on July 1st there were like massive surges of signups to mastodon and to blue skies. Oh this happens every time there's a weird future. Yeah. Literally anytime there's any sort of weird thing on Twitter you get like some surge and stir on all these sites. Yeah. Mastodon, T2, everything. Yeah. Probably not to talk about those after the break. We got to get to Twitter competitors, right? That's another own section. Oh yeah. And a fresh one. So we got some new things to talk about there. Yeah. But before we get there let's take one more quick break and let's do a trivia question. All right. Trivia question number two. Really hoping I know this one. Maybe maybe not. In the 2022 blind smartphone camera test. I should know this one. The Pixel 6A one first place. What phone came in third? Oh third? Well so there's two. You did see there's two phones that are tied for third or is there? Oh yeah. I got to get a time or yellow rating. What in 20? Oh because there's 22. Yeah. We didn't just kidding. No, we did do yellow. There is a third. So is it in which category overall overall? Overall, overall third highest. Yes. Okay. I should know this. Oh so all three of them put together. What? There's a standard photo, a low light photo and a portrait standard? No, he had overall. He did it. There was overall overall. Yeah. You know, I should know this. I should know this. One and I remember second place. Dang. Okay. Well second place. There's Pixel 6 Pro. Was it? Or was it not? I lived in the sheet for like two weeks. Seven pro. I know the bottom one. Be sure that was second. Be sure that was second. Yeah. I appreciate it. Almost Pixel 7 third. Seven pro. We didn't have a seven. All right. Time for break. Time for break. All right. Welcome back. So Mark, as you said, this new app you're trying is a four-shore Twitter killer. You said Twitter is probably going to be done by the end of the week. I think that's what you said off camera. That's what some advocates would interpret my statement as. Oh, but I'll read what I wrote. I'm going to expand on it. How about that? Sure. Like that. Okay. So what I tweeted and just for background, Twitter, mostly text-based, I think we can agree. It's it. Yeah. A lot. The number one thing Twitter has over Blue Sky and Macedon and T2 and all these other competitors has always been the people. That's what makes meta launching their Twitter competitor threads. So interesting. They'll pour it everyone's Instagram handles over and we'll just have people right away. And I tweeted that. I hit send. Got a lot of Instagram replies. I am currently using threads. I have the app on my phone. I'm in the early access group. It's going to go live right before this podcast goes up. So we will also be using threads by the time you will hear this. Follow us on threads. It's another one. But I think that's the interesting thing. And I guess I'll expand it to two things actually. The thing that Twitter has had over T2, Macedon, Blue Sky is infrastructure and people. Yeah. Infrastructure, I just say because they're a real company. And when I look at T2, they're slowly building features and bug fixing and they don't have an app yet. And we're going to figure out how to do DMs in the next month. They're really early. I don't think you can even block someone on T2 yet. Macedon is down all the time. Blue to be say what you want about Twitter, but they implement stuff for real and fast. Even if you hate what they're doing. Maybe two. Sometimes. So that's one thing. And meta has that. meta has that in spades. They're a real company that can make a real app with real features. And as soon as I use threads, I'm like, yeah, they built Twitter. They've got Reese shares. They've got DMs. They've got posts. They've got sharing images and videos. They've got profiles. They've built the connection with Instagram. They've just built it and they they have the infrastructure to keep building things. So that's number one. And the number two, I think we obviously Twitter doesn't have a ton of people compared to Facebook, whatever. I think it's maybe 300 million versus however many billion. But it does have a lot of like real people that people care about following. They've got athletes. They've got artists. They've got creators like us. They've got politicians. They've got all these sports teams. TV shows are all on Twitter. And mastodon T2, blue sky. There's a couple here and there. Like you might log in and be like, oh, cool. Like Oprah's on mastodon. Like I don't know. Randomly you'll see like a couple things pop up. But to me, it was always like, well, Twitter has everybody already. So even if the features are a little bit weird, at least that's where the people are and that's what I'm here for. And meta also has that because Instagram, Facebook, the social graph is built in. And I guess what's basically happening is when you sign up for threads, you keep your Instagram handle, I guess is how it works. You don't automatically get, you don't automatically follow everyone or get followed by people who follow your Instagram. But at least you have your handle and you're verified already. And they jump in and the people are already there. Like when I was using it pre-release as I've been using it, obviously, you know, Instagram employees, Zuck and Adam Asari and people like that. But also just like a bunch of celebrities are already on it using it kind of just like poking around. And I have a feeling that's just going to grow kind of the same way it was because everyone already uses Instagram and expects that. So those two things, infrastructure and people, they are what made Twitter better than its competitors. And this is the first competitor that's come along that has potentially both of those things right out the gate. And that's why it's interesting to see what happens. I have some questions. Yeah. Okay. Wait, I want to tell a story first. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, this morning David posted a slack saying like, oh, threads is like available and you can go to it and see it. Like it's not out. You can't just download it, but like the website is up. And then Marquez goes in real life, like in real time, yeah, I've been using this for like two or three days. Like in previous and I was like, the real life meme happened to us. Yeah. Like every time, I'm always like, oh, I've some exciting new information. And Marquez is just like, oh, I've been using that for a long time. It's popping. It's popping off over there. I have a ton of, I had to mute my threads notifications for the day because I guess because I got a notification for every everything. Yeah. Okay. So questions. Yeah. Number one, is the, does the app feel like really well built out? Like does it have basically all the same features as Twitter? Good question. So 80% yeah, 80% of all the stuff you'd expect. And I think they're probably going to add stuff that Twitter doesn't already have. So there is no like for you page, but there's like the sort of the homepage. I thank God. Can we see that? Yeah, you can. Let me, let me, let me screen record me. Yeah. Yeah. Screen record. So just to walk through the UI, there's the homepage, just like Twitter, you can like something, you can comment on something. Well, this looks exactly like it's quite something you can attach an image. Oh, you can do image sharing. It does crash in iOS 17 beta when I try to image share. So I'll say that. Yeah, it's just on the iPhone. But there is a media, you can share photos and videos. There's a search function so you can find new users and it does suggest a bunch. So look, oh, Gordon Ramsey's at the top. I can click in. He's got an avatar. He's got one thread. I can follow him. Cool. There's Compose, which is just a Compose window. There are likes and all your activity. So replies, mentions, verified, and your profile. Wait, Verif. Oh, no. So there is already a sorting mechanism for just people who are verified. They're building in this whole metavarified thing into this aren't they? Oh, yeah. 100%. Yeah. They're definitely going to do that. So that's it's all here. It's all. It's all working. Other question. Yeah. How high quality is the photo and video upload? Because Instagram is crap and Twitter before it got bought by Elon made a very strong push to make photo quality really good. And I really love that about Twitter. But Twitter never had any sort of like they have a media page, but they don't have like a curated like gallery page. Yeah. And something that I was hoping because this is like an Instagram sub product in a way, I was hoping maybe there would be some sort of like gallery linkage to your Instagram or something. Haven't seen that. Okay. And I actually haven't really pixel peep too much on the image quality either. I'll look into that. Because Instagram has a really low image quality. Yeah. Yeah. Everything is pixel everything you you fine tune detail and color and everything. Then you post it and you're like, what happened to my my precious. Yeah. Exactly. That's that may still be true about this. But yeah, they really didn't do any sort of features that Twitter hasn't done. Okay. So there aren't like a YouTube studio or like a Twitter analytic studio or anything crazy like that. There isn't like a new gallery view for images. They haven't really gone at crazy or done anything like super innovative. But they have built the bare bones like pieces of a text based social media. Do you know how many photos you can upload at once and what the video max time is? I have only tried to upload one and I have only seen people upload one. And I don't know what the max time is. But I only one if you can't upload like four at least that's. Yeah, four. I've only seen one. Can you try to do multiple right now and see what happens? So it crashes anytime I try. Right. I might not mind that work. But let's go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, add seven crash. It just crashes instead. Yeah. Again, the basics. Okay. It's got the basics. I would love to do like 10 photos. That would be amazing. Because the four the four max on Twitter has also been kind of annoying to me. You could thread it. Well, I think on Instagram, you can do a carousel of what eight 10 10 and on lemon eight, you can do a carousel of I believe eight or 10. That's not real. So I think they'll probably do that at some point. But right now, I think really it's just about like the social graph and the interestingness of it being a new place where all the people you already know are hanging out. Yeah. Kind of the main thing that's interesting. Looking at it right there, it looks like Twitter. And that's a great thing. Yes, it's great to be honest. Because exactly like you said, there are people already on it. It looks and seems like it's acting just like Twitter like scrolling through it. I'm just seeing random thoughts with gift replies and a place to look at my activities and a place to follow people in a way to look at my own profile. Like the notification page looks nice. You can split it up between verified users and all replies and just replies or likes and stuff like that. And it's also interesting. I separated replies from mentions. So if it's a new post that mentions you, that's one. That's really good. Why to something you posted. That's a different section. Yeah. Okay. Was I also going to say why I really lost my chance out there? Can you thread things yet? Well, yeah. So what's it calling post? It's called threads. Yeah. And basically every single post has a section where you can jump in and view specifically the replies. So I guess that's their mechanic for it being threads. I haven't been able to thread multiple threads together. I guess it's called threads. Can you like make a thread that has like when you finish you hit like add additional thread or add additional. Well, that's the character limit. Yeah. Is there a character limit? These are all good questions. Cause like I'm assuming if there isn't a way to do that, which is already where it's called a thread. And it feels like you can't thread it like you can on Twitter. So like is there a character? So you can thread it just by like adding it to this. Basically every post has a thread of all the replies underneath it and you can just add to that thread and just shows up in line. So I guess technically that's a thread. Okay. Character limit. Test test test test. It doesn't show up visually. It doesn't show a character count as your typing. Okay. Yeah. One thing I was going to say while you're trying to hit that character limit is when blue sky first launched on mobile, one of the most positive things that we were saying about it was wow, this looks exactly like Twitter. And if meta can like make something that looks exactly like Twitter. Cool. I will say that like Elon made this one point that it's like worst person you know, just made a great point. You did. What is it? It doesn't show how many characters I typed. Does it feel like more than Twitter? That feels like about the same. I'd say about the same. It's probably two eight. Don't know for sure. Two 40. That's a reasonable amount. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, Elon made this point where he was like, can't wait for the future when the every single social media app on the internet is owned by one company. And it's like, yeah, I mean, that's part of the reason I loved Twitter was that wasn't part of some mega corporation. But he also wants to turn Twitter into that. Yeah. He's burning it down. He wants it to be a mega corporation. And also it's like now it's bundled in with like Tesla and SpaceX. I guess that is a potential concern is that for like leaving Twitter because we want to get away from one like, oh, we don't like what Elon's doing now. You're running into the arms of stuff. Is that what's happening? The billionaires own our souls basically. Which threads isn't going to be launching in the EU because of that. Wait, really, yeah, at all because they don't meet the data privacy requirements in the EU. They're still working it out. Yes, it's not going to be coming out at launch. They're going to work on it. They're working on it to get to follow anyone in the EU. You probably do. Also, quick question. I'm wondering how do you think this is going to tie into Instagram? So that is my guess. That's a big question for me. For sure. So like stories, reels, those are baked into the Instagram app. And those are the things that I think of as successful Instagram taking things. Yeah. So I was like IGTV. Yeah. I did give you that. So that one. Yeah. I was told that you will be able to share threads to stories. And it'll link directly to the threads app, which is interesting. And so that's how I think at launch, a lot of people will be sharing their threads accounts is by sharing a thread into your Instagram and getting that audience over there. That actually does make a lot of sense because how many people screenshot tweets and post it as a story. Yeah. So if you could just directly share an actual link to a tweet, you have a better way of giving credit to the people and actually giving them because of it. Jump straight to that. Exactly. You get to, it's probably because it's your own post. There's probably some sort of verified something happening there just to make sure you can like actually link it. Yeah. Because of that, I could see this being Twitter, in general, out of all the social medias, if you were to make a sponsored post as a creator, is the worst, like, the worst deals you'll get. Like because engagement on Twitter is lower, it has less people, and in general, like it's swiped through pretty quickly. Instagram's higher. And being able to to link directly to Instagram, I could see marketing companies wanting to use threads more with creators than Twitter. If it actually gets to that point of being as big as Twitter. Also, if a lot of people feel like they're seeing double because they've heard this thread's name before, there was an app called Threads from Meta. It was a dedicated, it only closed down last year in 2021. But it was a dedicated Instagram DM app that it was like it used your Instagram account just for DMs. And I don't know why they had it. I think they were like kind of testing whether or not people, because a lot of people, a lot of younger people use like Snapchat as the main way they communicate. And I actually talk to a lot of people only really through Instagram DMs, because it's a pretty fully fledged messaging app. So they tested an app called Threads, which was just messaging. They shut it down two years ago. And now they're just resurfacing the branding. The funny thing is the word Threads makes a lot of sense because it's already called a Twitter thread. And so if you could just like threads for conversations, it's pretty good. It's a pretty good name. I think about the logo. It's like the at sign with an additional little loop, right? Yeah, it's pretty simple. Yeah. Black, white on black. Yeah. I don't hate it. It looks too much like a generic at to me. But and also the color of it is a lot like Instagram, right? I think it's just when you are the splash screen as Instagram colors, but everything else seems to be black and white. I'm interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know what's fine? And I just found something and I'm not sure it's going to do this. But there's a corner up at the top. There's an Instagram logo. When I hit that, it goes to my Instagram profile. I wonder if there's a thread's logo. That would be amazing. That's it. It goes back to my threads. That would be great. That seems like what they would do. That's like a very seamless transition as well. Yeah. That was really nice. I really liked that. It's funny because I've definitely built. I've built a lot of my following on Twitter. And now I'm like, I wish they were on Instagram. And I have like a very much smaller percentage on Instagram. But I would like more people to be on my Instagram because I actually put my photos there. So if I can have the cross compatibility. No, I totally agree. And to add on to that, like I've enjoyed using Instagram more, but you take a bunch of great pictures. I don't I just make like one mind jokes on Twitter every once in a while. So like I would like to go over there so they can go together. Yeah, I'll just take all right it on the screen. And take a picture of it. Oh, yeah. I posted on my store. Yeah. Obviously that would be a great profile. It doesn't all in brown do that. Oh, really? See does something like that. Everyone has some some version of how they post things. It's been done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, by the time you guys listen to or see this podcast, it will be out. So all of us. All of us was useless because they already have it. Yeah, they're all. They want to know. They thread at us on how you like it. I was going to ask that. So a tweet a Twitter post is called a tweet is a thread post just called a thread. It shouldn't be because a thread is still a function within the app. So I feel like they should call it. It's probably just going to be called a post. Yeah. And if you make a post and nobody replies, they're on no thread. So it can't be a thread. Exactly. You could thread a thread and have a like thread squared. You have to reply to yourself to make it a thread. Yeah. Yeah. As long as you don't use the thread emoji, how long do we have third-party thread apps? Never, never. I feel like the era of third-party apps is just over. Isn't thread also like the hometown tech thread is part of matter. It's part of matter. Yeah. Thread is part of matter. Keep those straight in my head. Yeah. Well, yeah. Thread is out. If you want to follow us on thread, yeah. We're going to be we're that we will be the same handles that we are on Instagram. Yeah. So follow us on Instagram and then follow us on. I was also going to ask pop quiz to you guys. I don't know if how much you keep track of this, but if you have to sort by a number of followers on social networks, how do you think we MKBHD channels rank YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, throw on Google+. You're so yours. Oh, YouTube number one. Yes. Instagram number two. Twitter two. No, Twitter two. Twitter two. T two. Six mil. Then four point something mill on Instagram. Yeah. 17 mill on YouTube. And you saw four points on Instagram. Yeah. Wow. There's more Twitter. Like, where do you go? Google+. Top out. 100 million. I'm guessing like two. Two million. Google+. Top that a little over five million. Five million. Wow. Those were big. Those are bots. We were I was one of just suggested follows when you follow. Oh, yeah. So it was. Oh, so Google was more than Instagram. At the time, it was the highest thing that was not YouTube for me. Wow. Yeah. That's wild. What's your T two? Think about 500. That makes you top one. That's more than actually on the site. Yeah. That's actually everyone on the site. Wow. Well, bird. All right. I think that's good to know. I'm not on Macedon. So if you guys are thinking you're following me on Macedon, it's not me. Here's another thing with. So threads at launch will not support it, but it will be supporting it. It will support activity pub. So you can post on Macedon and see on threads post on threads. See it on Macedon. So we will have third pretty third pretty thread apps. Yeah. If you use Macedon. Yeah. Technically. Yeah. I it's not available at launch, but they're going to make it available, which is interesting. I think that yeah, that is interesting. I think that it's a PR play because it doesn't. People still want to use like the official main app and Macedon still way too confusing for most people. So I think Zach is like, oh, it shows that we're not trying to own everything in that like, you know, you could technically use whatever you want. But like most people are still going to use the official app. So it's really good. The app first and then go. Yeah. It's a really good PR play to make them like look like they're supporting the open web. And also the first party app has to be the most important. It's like for like regular people. And this is going to link from Instagram as I'm imagining. Like it was going to be a button from Instagram to threads. Yeah. We'll just find it organically through that. That would be great. I would love that. That's going to be a thing that drives the most discovery. Yeah. Or they could have just turned to Instagram and to Twitter. Well, they had that weird feature, the broadcast feature. They still have that. And they still have it. And I think that was the beginning of this. Have you gotten these? Yeah. Or they like send out a message. Yeah. That's weird. That just feels like a spam call. Yeah. Yeah. So I sent you a photo. And I'm like, what? And it's just a mass message to all their followers. I think that I had that happen on my phone while I was showing my phone to someone. And they were like, what? Yeah. Yeah. Socks. Just like a photo. Yeah. It sounds like a mall. It's been I had to explain. Yeah. We fight in cage matches like twice a week. Yeah. We've been sparring. Anyway. Okay. That's it for this week. This week on Waveform, of course. We will probably talk more about these social media things as they grow and expand and evolve. So let us know in the comments what you guys think, what you want us to talk about and follow us on all those things. And follow us on all those things. We will now attempt to answer the questions that Adam asked at the beginning. It's trivia time. Attempt to try. I am not going to get these right. I really thought I knew what the second one was, but I don't know any more. I have a million. I have an idea. I definitely don't have the first one. First question. What was the first commercially available smartphone with wireless charging? God, that is tough. I have. I'm so between two of them that if it's the wrong one, I'll be so mad. But if it's neither of them, then I won't be that. Yeah, that's exactly what you know. I'm changing what I originally put. Just cross it out. Don't erase. I know the first commercial phone with two gigabytes of RAM. I guess probably think that you see they just announced a phone with 24 gigs of RAM. Yeah. Really? I don't know what it was. It's a separate match. Some parts of gaming phone. Well, I burn up my time. I don't know the answers. Oh, wow. Oh, that might be right. I said the Nexus 4. It's not right. It's not right. I said the S2. Wrong. Who's closer? None of you actually. Well, I guess technically Andrew's kind of close, because I think the Galaxy 6 was the first Samsung Galaxy phone. That's what I did with the 6 Edge, something like that. Really? But the first one with wireless charging was actually the ASUS and phone 2. No. Okay, good. The Nokia 920 according to computer world. It came out in 2012. Wait, that's a Windows phone. It's not a smartphone. That's a smartphone. That's still a smartphone. Yeah. I don't know. What was it? The Nokia 920. Oh, oh, yeah. The, yeah. Was that the one made by HTC? There's a black polycarbonate. It is a thick phone. Yeah, it's a thick boy. It's the dumbest phone. Oh, I did a video on how I remember that. I did the 920 and the 1020 and I like that camera. I like how they have that camera and then they have the one with the Chonker 40 megapixel camera. That was the 1020. That's the first computer world. Okay, but what was the first Android phone with wireless charging? I don't know. 2012. I should be asking you that. Oh, the back of this 920. It's just like, well, a red square. And then just like, this is a little tiny camera with a thing that says, Nokia, it's taking up like 5% of the old tiny camera. Horrible looking. All right, next question while David Google's what the first Android phone was with wireless charging. In 2022, the blind smartphone camera test, the Pixel 6A one first place. What phone came in third? Overall, an elo rating. This is our own smartphone camera test. Yeah, I didn't look at the data as much as Andrew did. Andrew lived in this data for like three weeks. Yeah. He just slept under his desk. Maybe I'll blurred together for him. It's definitely. That's kind of what I'm hoping for. All right, flipping and read. I put Zenfone 9. All right. I'm so mad. I didn't get it. I assumed this was a trick question because we talked about the Zenfone. Wait, I need this moment. I need this moment. I also put Zenfone 9. Let's go. I also wrote the order of top four. I don't know if I'm all 20 clothes. Wait, I'm still in this. 20. Exactly. That's what I'm at too. Wait, Andrew, what did you put? I put the ROG. I almost put the ROG. I was like, but it's talking about Zenfone being good. And then I thought he was going to be like, oh, they're going to put the Zenfone. And I was like, well, I know the Zenfone did you guys want to bonus point? Yes. No. Bonus point. What was in fourth place? He wrote that down. It's hard. I wrote it. What would you put? S22 Ultra. Wrong. It was the Oppo 5 index 5. Oh, I'm mad. I should have put 5 index as my guess for third time. That's a care member. All right. So new scores. David 24. Andrew and Marquez tied naked naked 20. Which is a great set of scores together because next episode is the trivia extravaganza. Yes. So you don't say. My question is, does the fact that my head does not matter now because it's a very extravaganza? No, it does. Oh, no. It's like going from jeopardy to double jeopardy. You technically have an advantage, but it's not that. Wow. Bummer. Everyone that's fallen up until now, please congratulate me because I'm going to lose. You won the regular season. Now you got to bring it in the play. Yeah. Exactly. I'll see about that first run. I always crash. Either way, that's been it for this week on Waveform. Thanks for listening. Thanks for watching. Catch you next week in our trivia extravaganza. Well, we'll set up this one for all. Who is really truly the most trivia, technological on this podcast? Wow. That was really good. Have you said that before? No. Did you just come up with that? Just off the dome. Yeah. Nice. Oh, poet. Thanks for watching. See you later. Bye. Waveform was produced by Adam Alina and Ellis Riven.

We're your hosts. I'm Arches. I'm Andrew. And David, as you can tell, is currently not here. He's out. He's, I think he's taken some pictures in the Pacific Northwest somewhere. So we'll see him when he gets back. Yeah, follow him on Instagram because he's posting a lot of them and they're pretty sick so far. Some previews of those. But in today's episode, we have a little bit of Twitter versus threads. Around two, I've got some thoughts. Is it round two? We've definitely talked about them like specifically once. Yeah, it feels like it's sort of a second wave of Twitter versus stuff, I think so. Yeah. But we also have a little bit of a hype or not game to play at the end. So it's not a full game show episode, but we still have games. We've done it before and I think people liked it. It's a lot of fun to just like speculate about things that are maybe too hyped or not hyped enough. Yeah, I like playing hype versus not hype games. Yeah. But first we did both, we traveled or we did. You did something pretty cool. I had a trip. Right. So you want to, it's called the open. Right. Open the open and the couple days before the open was something called the open invitation. Okay. First time they've ever done it. So some of you guys may or may not know this, but I'm a golfer. I've been a golfer for, and I actually someone asked me this. I've heard this part, yeah. I've been a golfer for 20 years. Isn't it wilds that we are at a point in our life that you can say you've done something? I've been snowboarding for like 23 years at this point and I thought about that like, whoa, that's weird to say. It's weird. But yeah, I've been golfing for 20 years. I'm not as good as you would think as someone old. When you say, when you say I allowed that you've been doing something for 20 years, you think you're really good at it. I'm not. I've been playing on and off and obviously we have other stuff that we do. My first love, my first sport. So it was super cool to be able to play on the golf course that is in championship condition because the open, the major is being played there, basically as we speak. And it was actually sort of a practice round day. So a lot of the pros showed up by Walk Through Security right in front of Phil Michelson, put it on the putting green with him. And it was like a new event to sort of hype it up a little bit. So it was sort of a team's format and a bunch of invited sort of celebrity guest people and we played a scramble and we played the whole course and it was amazing. That's true. That was awesome. You guys won too, right? And we won the scramble. That's awesome. Yeah. I'll tell you what, there's nothing like first T-Gitters when there's first T-Gitters in any sport where you first drive and hit your first shot or hit the court for the first time, take your first shot. But when you're not used to playing in front of a crowd, the amplifier of people watching you, you don't get to appreciate on TV how many people there are and how close they are to you. You can hear people motor things under their breath. It's that close to you. And they've been watching making this shot. They've been watching professionals the whole day, like getting amazing shots and then we walk up and we're like, sorry, this is going to be a little worse than that. But no, it was sick. That's true. It came on the tail end of a ADL double header in Colorado and Salt Lake that we also won both games. That's awesome. And you can watch that. It was live streamed, right? I skimmed through and tried to watch all of your shots and I don't know golf, but they looked pretty solid. The announcers liked it. Yeah, yeah. I played okay. Obviously we won. We had a great team. Shout out to Catherine. She was the best player of the entire group and she was an under shot. Yeah, she had a six shot. She hold out for eagle on the last hole in front of the whole crowd. It was unreal. So yeah, go watch that. It'll be on YouTube. We'll put that link in the show notes if you want to check it out. You also went on your cancel. I didn't get you exactly the way to get there. You rescheduled it. I went to Grand Teton National Park in Yellowstone National Park and it was like beautiful tons of animals. I posted some photos, some really crazy wildlife photos. I never thought I'd be able to get in my life because I rented an awesome one. Yeah, I have a couple of grizzly bear shots, which is pretty cool. I'm actually making a video for the studio channel right now. Kind of about some of the tech that I like to bring because I talk about hiking way too much on the podcast. So I figured let's get it all in one video so I can maybe shut up about it for like a few months and then we'll get all the gear, all the nerding out of all the stuff. Exactly. Yeah, so that'll be up there soon. But we also just posted another video on the studio channel that was like a total banger from Ellis, his first solo hosted video. Do you want to tell us a little bit about it? No. Okay, sit. Go watch it. Definitely go watch it. It's really good. It's really funny and really insightful. I like learning experience. Yeah. But the week I was supposed to be on vacation, I missed a little bet that you guys had and Adam just posted it on shorts and I wanted to kind of get in on this because I just get in on the cyber truck. On the cyber truck bet. Okay. So I think the bet was 25 non-employees received delivery by the end of 2023. Yeah, well, it actually happened. I say yes. Everyone else said no. I'm going to agree with you on this one. Actually, which thank you. It's come on. Hit the buzzer. I know you're looking for it. It's fine. Man, I'm telling you. So yes, I agree with you. I still think it'll be under 100. I think it's going to be a very small amount. I don't think it's going to be a lot. So we're all excited about it and everyone on Twitter is like, oh my god, it's coming. Brother, it's kind of announced in 2019. Like, oh, no. No, no, no, no, I know you're not. I just need to say it. We're excited. But like, man, this thing was out there and I was just thinking how many other EV pickup trucks have come out since that, since they got announced and just like the lead they thought they were going to have in the pickup space world and how much they blew that lead away. It's been really interesting. I don't know how much I thought it would matter that they were first to be an EV pickup truck. Like, yes, Rivian came out before them and that was their thing. Was they were the first EV pickup truck, basically, ship. And I don't know how much it helps to be the first one if it's $100,000. And then the F-150 Lightning comes out and I am seeing a lot of them on the road and it's an F-150, so it should be popular. But the Cybertruck also has, I don't know, how many, I'll Google it. How many million pre-orders are there for the Cybertruck? I mean, a $100 refundable. Also, the order is like a weird, which for Tesla is a great little four-year interest-free loan they got. But yeah, I do think it, I kind of think it is pretty important, especially if you're not accompanying known for doing pickup trucks. So I think the fact that Rivian got in there first, probably helped Rivian quite a bit to be able to say first EV pickup is, and then when Ford comes out, you know people who are Ford loyal are going to go for it. Yeah, they had a ton of people in mind. We were talking to Ford about this. They had tons of people pre-ordering F-150 Lightning and for many of them it was their first truck and for many of them it was their first Ford. And so, you know, just like getting an EV just changes the equation for a lot of people. So yeah, I think Cybertruck, it's still going to come out in this sort of new-ish age of EVs. And I think it's going to have an impact. It kind of reminds me of a hot take that I'm going to talk about in a hot take video, which I kind of want to spoil a little bit, because I think it's one of the funniest ones. Just try to do it, send it. Okay, one of the hot takes that I'm going to address in the video with a little more precision than this is someone said the Cybertruck is going to outsell the F-150 by 2026. Can I confirm the F-150 or the F-150 Lightning? The F-150. I did the same thing. That person is optimistic, I would say. That person is, I don't even know a nice way to say it. That's one of the dumbest takes I've ever heard. So you can buy what's your self-worth when? 2026. So three years. Zero shots. Okay, but think of it this way. If you're a Tesla fan and you see, this is the, I'm going the the most optimistic route. Okay, there's a million and a half pre-orders of the Cybertruck right now. Let's say they start shipping at the end of this year and they make them all in the first two years. And by the time they start making them the third year, they have another million people order. So by 2026, they shipped all the pre-orders and they're going to make another million new orders. That would put it on pace to match the F-150. Now the chances that they actually ramp up production that fast and sell all the ones and nobody cancels and they sell all the ones they made and make another million orders very, very low. But the F-150 sells like 600 to 900,000 every single year and it's the most successful vehicle in America. So if you're saying it's going to overtake the most successful vehicle for the past 40 years running in three years, you're an optimist and it's probably a hot take and I like that it's hot but it's probably not going to happen. Just put it at that. Yeah, I just don't think there's any shot that that happens. I mean, it's four years of pre-orders, right? And even that is barely what Ford actually sells. Honestly, I think the most of the pre-orders happened in the first year. I do think so also, but that's why I don't see that pre-orders getting finished and X amount more coming in. You hit a very huge part of the ones that you think you're going to sell, those aren't all going to sell and then you're not going to get a higher influx once it actually comes out. Especially with now R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, I'll say that the Hummer pickup truck, but I don't think that's much. And the Silverado is already getting test driven by journalists now. So there's quite a few. I think that comes out probably around the same time and there's other options at this point. Don't forget the Lord's Town. Yeah. So I'm actually good to see you. If you're not watching my video version, I'm sorry for that. I don't actually mean that. There's a, but we were talking this morning because I wanted to say it's interesting how many pickup EVs got announced and delivered since the Cybertruck got announced. And I thought the Rivian was announced after, but it was actually a year before the Cybertruck, which I didn't realize. And I think that just kind of goes to prove that when you're an EV company, no one knows about and you announce a truck, no one takes it seriously because to me, until the Rivian started like showing up, I didn't really take them seriously. So this Lord's Town stuff, like no part of me considers this a thing that I'm going to ever see until I start actually seeing that's totally fair. I think the difference is with Rivian, it was their first ever vehicle. And so it's hard to take anything they do seriously until they start shipping their first ever vehicle. And that's true about for a future. And that's true about Lord's Town. And that's true about so many others. But why I think it's different with Tesla is this not their first rodeo, which is why when I see them starting to test meals and roll around camo versions of it, it seems like they're actually ramping up to something real where the others I could never prove that. Yeah, I agree. I think you clarified what I meant there is more like these new EV companies as they're just first EV in general. Like, Tesla's been around for longer, but it's also been four years. So maybe I shouldn't have given them as much trust as I thought I did. And it's impossibly hard to make an EV truck and we're all learning. But it's a simple stamp that so many fleets they can just stamp out a bunch of them. That's why the designs like that man. They'll just roll out like nothing in a legend for years. This thing is a 6,000 pound guillotine with electric motors. I will say, this is true. And I think it's weird because I keep hearing this about the Cybertruck, but like the Hummer EV and the Rivian are both over 7,000. I think the Hummer EV might be over 9,000. Yeah, and it's bigger than the Cybertruck. And it's admittedly it's not sharp on the corners. That's definitely a difference. And I don't know how that plays into these tests or whether it'll get pulled. Yeah, it also has crumple zones. The Cybertruck, they're really big on the fact that like, this thing won't crumple. It'll just go through despite having a front trunk. Whatever you hit, which is good for the occupant, but not whatever you hit. It's good for the occupant in theory, right? Assuming you just do go clean through. But remember that the whole point of a crumple zone is to slow down. It's to send energy around the vehicle, past the passenger compartment. So there is a very realistic chance that your truck will be perfectly fine. And you will be like a chef boy, R.D. Can in this area. The windows are bulletproof so you won't go through them. Don't worry. You can just splat up a guy. I feel like I should say before the Tesla boys come out too late. The model three and the model S are some of the safest cars money can buy. Biggest crumple zones in any vehicle. Yeah, the NHTSA says like those are at the top of the chart. So maybe they've got some tricks out there sleeve. But to me, this just seems like they should make this illegal to drive around schools, right? There's a like, there's no way any grade schooler could survive getting hit by a Tesla truck, which is so high off the ground, they couldn't see them anyway. I don't know how different it'll be than the Hummer EV. The thing, even just outside of EVs, the trucks and like SUVs were driving in America are so dangerous towards pedestrians every way. And we let them drive all the time. Like I just don't see anyone actually stopping the cyber truck as being any more dangerous as these. The amount of times I've almost been like clipped on the side of a sidewalk in town because some lifted pickup truck. I was just in Uber. Yeah. In the city and we're in like a Denali or a Yukon XL or something. And it's just like riding in it. I'm just like we are Kings of the road right now. Yeah, this is insane. They're so high and they have such a big front and like front grille and everything. It's hard to see over. And if you're in the blind spot of them, it's dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. It's terrifying. Let's put a blade on it. Yeah, let's make it go zero to 60 in three seconds. And drive it. This is why the Hummer was hilarious when it came out. It was like the Hummer just 9,000 pound massive refrigerator of a vehicle can also do a zero to 60 in three seconds. How does that make any sense? I think the only reason I'm more scared of the cyber truck is just I know there'll be more of them on the road. Whereas the Hummer EV just like I think it's a pretty niche vehicle. So I'm not as but like if I saw Hummer EV on the highway, I probably would just pull over, take a break and just like wait for that thing to be far away from where I am. That's fair. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see if the deliveries happen and and then if they reverse the deliveries, we'll have to come back to that bet. But I stand it's not I don't think it's coming out this year. It's really dumb. All right. Well, I think that's a good spot to take a quick break. We got a lot to talk about with threads and Twitter. But of course before we do breaks, it's time for trivia. Start of the season. All fresh. What number season is it? Three. Is it this season? Three. Okay. You won season two. You also won season one. So six. Okay. First question coming from Ellis. All right. So I was reading on the internet as one does. And I found out that you can wake up a computer from sleep using just the internet. You don't even have to be at the same room. In order to do that, you send a very particular message to the target computer to wake it up. It's a very silly name. That's why it's trivia question. What is the name of that message? This is multiple choice or yeah. Am I need multiple chase for this one? You know what? I'll make up some choices. I was going to say I mostly want it because I want to hear your made up versions of your you know what? I'll just off the dome right now. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Number one, a stop STOMP. These are all acronyms. Number two, Womp WOMP. Number three, Klomp. At number four, alarm, wild card. All right. I'm impressed by the off the dome. I have a feeling that some of them rhyme. Yeah. And that helps a little bit. I'll be brainstorming on that through the break. Answers are at the end as usual. We'll be right back. All right. We're back. So we've been using Twitter for years. Yes. And we've been using Meta's threads for about two weeks now. Two weeks. Do you call it meta all the time? I still call Facebook. I do have to remember to call it meta. Okay. And sometimes I don't. I just say Facebook. But it does say like when you have the splash green meta. So you know, I get reminded of it. Yeah. We have a lot of thoughts. I've been using them both. I'm interested. You know, various intents in and I think you kind of see the waves now of things happening with each of them. Yeah. I don't want to we were saying it's like the second wave, but it almost feels like the fourth wave. Like the first wave was the date launched, which was in the midst of a trough with Twitter, because they had like the rate limit scandal and all this is happening. And then threads launches and explodes. Right. And there's tons of people joining tons of engagement. You could consider that the first wave. Okay. Even though there was like the zero wave of like all the pre-release testers. Then I'll leave that out. Then the second wave was like, all right. It's sort of stabilized for like four or five days in 70 million, 100 million users. All right. We're here. What do we do now? And then Twitter on the other side is like a little bit quieter than usual. And you're kind of looking around Twitter like interesting. I feel like there's last posts happening, but also like a day off. Is it a holiday? Why isn't anyone on the road today? It's like a tumbleweed going across. And then the third wave was then suddenly like all of the here I am engagement farming posts happening on threads. And then all the like threads versus Twitter talk. And then I feel like the fourth wave is now Twitter flips a switch, turns on a monetization feature starts writing a bunch of checks. And like literally the other day there was a post from Adam Asari that they had to turn on rate limits because suddenly there's a bunch of spam happening. And they needed to actually slow that down. And so now it's sort of equalizing. And obviously the spike in engagement at the beginning is what you'd expect to see. But it's never going to hold to that level. But it is at a different place. So there's a lot to go over with where we see both of these platforms going. Yeah. And the last time we talked about it was by the time the episode came out that launch date had happened. But when we were talking about it, we were just basing it off of your like day before pre-release and talking there. So like we haven't really covered that whole step through process that you just mentioned all the waves. So do you want to like really quickly go over how you've been using threads and what you've thought about it so far? Sure. Yeah. So I mean, it launched and there's always just that like fun first couple days of something new where you just play around with it. So our poking around, you know, I think I I tagged just random people. I tagged Mark Cuban. I said, can I be a guest on Sharknank? And he was like, yeah, let me get back to you on that. I like the idea. I tagged Zach in a feature request. And he was like, yeah, but it's on the list. Like just kind of poking around and seeing what's happening and things are all moving and colorful and exciting. It's fun. That part is fun. Like everybody's just like, what do we do here? Yeah. And like it's the difference I think of that is what we've talked about a million times before is that the user base is so important on all of these. Like we all dealt with this on Blue Sky and T2 and mastodon. But now within, was it not 24 hours threads already had more than probably all three of those combined? Probably within hours. Yeah. Yeah. So like you get to actually experience this like, hey, this is kind of neat. Yeah. Everyone's nice. What do we do? It's like walking into a party and like so many people you know are there and you're like, whoa. Oh, you're here too. Oh, wow, you're all here. That's crazy. What are we talking about? What are we doing here? And you're so excited. You don't get into the like toxic hellscape argument of like the regular Twitter thread. And that was just nice for like a week. Yeah. I think then once you've gotten over the hump of like, right, we're all here. We're all trying to do stuff. Then it's like, what do we post here? And and this is from someone who posts on social media for a living. I'm like, do I post the same things that I'm posting in other places or do they not belong here? I saw at the beginning so many, you know, and so much emphasis from the founders about things like conversations and just text posts and it's it's called threads. It's literally just like text threads. People talking to each other. So I kind of assumed I'd mostly just be using it like Twitter in like text threads. Not a lot. I'm not in post in a YouTube link. So I wasn't thinking about posting any, you know, photos or videos, even though you still can technically. But then the question is like, well, I just posted some short form video on Instagram. Do I also post it on threads? Is that like double posting? I posted on Twitter. Maybe I posted on threads in Twitter, but not Instagram or Reels or shorts is I don't know. It's kind of just a weird. There's a thought process now to it. So that that's in the back of my head the whole time. But then also I do find it fun to engage with shorts because it does for me still feel like it has this second fastest engagement rate of any social network behind Instagram. Sorry, your threads are short. You said shorts. Threads, okay. Yeah, so like on Instagram, if I post something within 10 minutes, there's over a hundred comments. There's probably 10,000 likes and you can just see just chaos activity happening where that's very different on Twitter versus shorts. YouTube shorts has almost the opposite like a low two-day burn before it hits the shorts feed and then takes off. So shorts is just or threads is just interesting to just like poke around and reply to something and just see how fast you can talk to people on threads before the threads over. Yeah. And from that first week, like despite having wildly, like less people on the platform and less followers than like Twitter that I had, like the engagement I was getting felt kind of crazy. I think just everyone was so excited to be on it. They were on it a lot more. They were replying all over the place. There was engagement everywhere. Everyone was like, oh, shoot, I didn't realize you're on here yet. Like what's up? Did you follow the, did you follow everyone that you follow on Instagram or did you, did you follow separate people? It's funny because it's more along the lines of the people who I follow on Twitter because Instagram to me is still been this slow move over of more of my personal life versus this social media work life, I guess. And on threads, I found it really interesting because a lot of people that I do know in my personal life on Instagram that don't have Twitter were creating threads. And then you could see, yeah, just some of their stupid little, that's what I love about just like very short text-based posts is like you can just have one random thought and that thought can be hilarious. And it just makes my day. That's the most pure like early version of Twitter. It's incredible. I love it so much. That's like when you can open this sweet from your phone. Yeah. And you can do it. It was just like a hundred forty years. Like when you're sending a text message to it. Yeah, just a 140, just a blurb of a thought. Yeah, that's kind of how it starts. And I think now you're seeing like the people who are here to get engagement, you're going to figure out like how to turn this into a page. There's the LinkedIn bros showing up, like trying to optimize and like doing all these crazy things like you expect that with any new shows, even though it's not monetizable directly. Yeah, it's still you expect that. That was kind of the fun part of the beginning. It was like when that happened, people were like, no, get that off. No, this platform's fun right now. Get that grind set crap off of here. Like yeah, block that mute that. Yeah. But I think like like you said, one of the biggest issues of it off the beginning, or you didn't say it, but this is what you tweeted at I think Adam responded to you about just having an actual front page with the people you follow, not random people. And they did say they're working on it, which is great. I'm a little worried it's going to be, which is similar to Twitter now where that's not going to be your main. You're going to have to swipe into it as a secondary one. That is always fascinating to me because every social media has to have some balance of this where you follow people because you want to see what they post. But in order for them to be successful and keep you engaged, they need to be giving you new things. It's almost like on Spotify, like we have the music that we want to listen to. But there's also like if you hit shuffle, it's going to just toss in some music you've never heard before. It's going to toss in some explore weekly or whatever. And that's what TikTok has got. TikTok is probably the far end of the scale. You don't even really check who you follow. Most people don't check who they follow. It's just the for you page. And on the other side, maybe it's closer to like Twitch or YouTube. Back in the day, I only watched twice subscribe tube. And now it's mostly homepage. It's things that recommend YouTube getting closer to that that TikTok side where like I'm watching people that I realize I'm not subscribed to because I'm just so consistently getting fed their stuff that I enjoy. So Instagram now too, it used to just be like people you follow in the post that they make with the photos. Now it's just like tossing stuff in my feed. Obviously the explore page and reels is giving you new stuff. So now they're pushing towards that. So now threads shows up. And of course, we're following a bunch of people. We're engaging with a bunch of stuff. But yeah, the homepage is full of people you don't follow. And so as a purist, I want just the list of people that follow in the things that they post because that's why I'm here. I just joined threads to follow 12 people. But they don't even have a following count for people. They just show you the homepage and you can follow people on the homepage, but it's constantly pushing you new stuff. And that's just the way social is in 2023. And I guess it's cool that it's on their list, but I kind of doubt it's very high on their list. Yeah, or it's not going to be like a default. Because Instagram, you can do only following chronological, but it's not even like in Twitter where you just swipe over. It's like a drop-down menu, yeah, which then you have to do every time you open the app, I think, which is my suspicion is it will never be the default. I totally agree with that. Yeah. I did. Sorry. Quick question. When do you think they're going to add ads? Ads. Because I think a big part of why people like it right now is because there's no ads. It's very pure with no ads. I think meta has the bank role to be able to roll this for a little bit without ads. And I think that's probably the smartest decision to eventually don't add and make a ton of money on it. But they, I think we all can probably agree. They push this pretty quickly in a very opportune moment with what was going on with Twitter. So why not completely capitalize on Twitter, maybe, uh, stuff. I feel like they already like, I think they did. I think they did a lot of the thing that they're still definitely and don't mess a stuff mode, I think. Yeah, the pressure needs to just stay on. Yeah. Like I think Twitter can have a bad week and it's fine. But if you have a really good couple of months in a row on threads and it's the activity still going and like you didn't ruin it with ads yet, then you start to really think about like, all right, we're actually taking real meaningful market share. We're actually changing the landscape of social media. Then maybe you start thinking about, okay, we'll do a little bit of ads here and there. Yeah. And there's a, there's a benefit to being having multiple different social media sites and products that are making money and then one being able to lose some versus spending $44 billion immediately having the worth of that and then having to try and make up for all the loans that you take. Yeah, but Metta's also like burning money in VR and AR. So like they need something to give them money right now. They've got some others. They still have Facebook and Instagram. That's true. Yeah. Cash clienty of money. Okay. So the next question, how long until Google makes one Google everyone with a Gmail already gets an account. You just bring it over. I was this is why I was do you remember how many things Google plus did to read like Google plus was ahead of its time for real. Google plus, which I used for every year it was out as I've mentioned many times before. But like do you remember when there's a plus one plus one button on everything on Google search? There are still like I'll still see some trucks with advertisements on them that will still show their social media links and they'll be like a Google first. I don't know why. Yep. On YouTube, they forced everyone to turn their profile into a Google plus account. So you could only like you could plus one comments plus one videos, share it to your circles. They forced all of that like the same way that we got this like nice plug with Instagram for threads to take off. They did that with Google search and YouTube. So the fact that that doesn't exist anymore is a pretty good indicator that you can't really brute force your way into it. It's got to be good. But like Google, Google tried Google did try. So yeah, but they tried like 14 years ago. They gave it a good old Google try like whoa, this didn't work immediately. Cut it. I totally remember when they did that and like being however old I was like a child and like watching the Philip DeFranco video where he's like going over like yeah, they're making everyone sign up from Google plus and I remember just childhood me being like this is an outrage. Yeah. Yeah. As if it like affected me at all. That's amazing. It was it was a it was a it seemed like a turning point on the internet because Google had that kind of power where like if you got a lot of plus ones on your site that would specifically improve your search ranking. And that's already an incentive to be strong on Google plus. That was the gamification of that would be out of this world more than SEO right now. Like they should just go back to that and that'll be again the way that you write that platform will be destroyed by bots and like people just turning it into a total mess by gamifying everything. I mean, Google never said specifically what how much of a percentage the Google plus thing had to your ranking. But it became very clear that like you wanted to be strong on Google plus you want to be the most plus one thing on your search page to get you to the top. You were the second most plus one thing. Where it's you? Maybe. I don't know. I was one of the I was one of the accounts that they suggested you follow when you joined. That's awesome. So that was pretty solid for that's a badger bomber. Yeah, that was pretty cool. So yeah, I don't know. I do think the the Instagram poll is very strong, but I don't think the growth phase is over yet. I still think they have to they're still in don't mess this up mode. And as people poke around and find what to do, they can add the features that people seem to want the most. Yeah, they're definitely in like a slight you know, they they had their high of like everybody joining right away. And now it's going to dip a little bit and exactly what you said. Don't screw this up so that dip doesn't go too far down and that dip it steadies off. And then I found one thing that I think threads can do that Twitter and Instagram can't do except when I tried to do it, it didn't work. So let me explain it. I was at the airport. And I think the reason this didn't work is just because of poor airport Wi-Fi. That's why it didn't post. But if you think about it, threads is the only place that you can post more than four images that don't all get automatically cropped to square because once you had more than two photos on Instagram and a gallery, it auto-crops it into a square. And you can only do four photos on Twitter. So I took all these different pictures and different aspect ratios and portrait and landscape. I was cropping them. And I wanted to post all the photos that took on my trip. And I could do that on threads, except that it just kept failing to post in the airport Wi-Fi. And it didn't actually go through. So I just wound up cropping them on Instagram. Some things like that feel like features when I think really they're just not yet pruned. Like they're going to definitely limit that. You think they're going to limit that? Yeah. They're kind of the same. It's meta. Like they're going to probably find a way to compress more efficiently. And they're going to find ways to reduce the amount of bandwidth you need to use to post. And maybe if everyone's, you saw David was posting, he was had these huge panoramas and landscape that would take up your entire phone. I wish he was here so we could talk about this because I feel like that is something he would enjoy. David is definitely not taking 10 square pictures at once and wants to post more than four out of time. So I'm sure that would, if it works, work well for him. He's giving you that iMacs experience on threads, you know. It's longer than your phone. You can only view it on a Sony Xperia phone. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Before we get into Twitter and what they were doing, Twitter had to have been, if we step back to Wave 1 here, there's just something a little peculiar about if you posted any threads links on Twitter that I think is pretty obvious and just very funny, but it was clearly suppressing. Right. I think I have a picture here of your timeline. You posted something that just says, it's actually impressive how bad Siri is. 8.4 million impressions on Twitter. Next post. For some threads and the link to your threads link, 200,000 impressions. And then another video of a caviar iPhone 1.1 million impressions. Yeah. Some of this is a little fishy there. Interesting. Yeah. I don't think it would be a shock to anyone if they uncovered just the word threads or any threads that you are. Yeah. They're definitely not showing that to people the way to show other things to people. Not shocked by that. I don't honestly, this is like a part of social also where I think when you post a lot of social media and you're trying to optimize all your content, you're like, what do these platforms incentivize and how can I ride those waves on Twitter or on any website? Like on YouTube, they do not like you sending people to external websites, period. So on YouTube, if you have a really popular link at the top of your description and that link is sending people somewhere, like I remember we used to do giveaway videos. And a lot of people would use like a giveaway hosting service or whatever. Like some thing. And there will be a link at the top. And those videos would always bomb. Really? Because you're sending people off the site and YouTube is going, whoa, whoa, we don't like this video. This video is sending people off of YouTube. And so you do this massive giveaway, but it would get like a 10th and normal traffic. Do you know another good example of that is? Doesn't shorts have a thing that sees if the TikTok logo isn't it because they don't want you to just take your exact TikTok video that also shows a link to how you follow them on TikTok? I'm not sure if they've admitted this yet, but a lot of them definitely. I think that was like a pretty obvious. Yeah, I'm not sure if it was shorts or reels. I think it's a real, it's a TikTok logo. I think that's the one everyone knows about. But I'm also pretty sure like if YouTube sees a TikTok logo, they don't want to push that either. Yeah. Yeah. That's a fact. It's already funny. It's also very funny that threads has an immediate share to Twitter button, which is just like I'm sharing essentially my tweet on a different bro to Twitter. But yeah. But let's talk about Twitter. Yeah. Twitter, Twitter, want through some stuff. Twitter had that like sort of a quiet couple days. You know what it felt like? It felt like New York City after the hurricane. After hurricane. It was like two days and it was like, it's kind of quiet. Which is kind of cool. It's yeah. It's kind of like, you don't usually see it like that. Post apocalyptic Twitter. Yeah. There was some graph of a, I think it was a cloud flare thing. It's trying to show that like Twitter traffic did actually tank for a little bit. I don't even know how accurate that would represent everyone's Twitter experience. But if you use Twitter every day, you probably noticed there was less stuff happening. It came back. Lots of random things keep happening at Twitter. And then one big thing that happened is they started doing payouts for verified users who are in like a revenue sharing program. Yeah. It's essentially if you now get a portion of the revenue that is created through the ads that are only posted inside your replies. So I'm sure we've all noticed that replies on Twitter have ads now. Very annoying. But I get it. Yeah. So those specific ads will now benefit the creator that it gets posted under. Yeah. I tweeted to my subscribers on Twitter. So if you are a subscriber on my Twitter, you saw this a week or two ago. But I got a screenshot because I just like got a pop up when I open Twitter one day. It says congrats at mkbhd. As your share of ads revenue and replies, you're receiving $6698. Your portion will be deposited into your Stripe connected account within the next 72 hours. Thanks for being creator on Twitter. And you just hit okay. And that's it. There's no analytics. There's no. Oh, this isn't the last 30 days. This is there's no like here's the tweet that generated you the most or like any information. This is the only information I've gotten about this. And I can go into my analytics and try to find more. I can go into my Stripe account and try to find more almost nothing. But interesting. But everyone got this screenshot of like, oh, I'm going to get paid for my tweets, I guess. Yeah. So let's take I had some questions. It sounds like yeah, you can't really answer them. So my favorite thing to do on waveform. Let's speculate. Sure. There's a bunch of people and some people are getting paid a lot of money. I mean, I saw multiples over $10,000. Yeah. But one interesting thing here is my two main questions are one. It says that this is retroactive back to February, February when it was announced. Interesting. So if you think about that, then this isn't just like 30 days worth like six months. This is like six months worth that makes a lot of which is a lot which under why a lot of these are very big. Do you have a separate payment for subscriptions? Yes. It is separate. So that is not included in this. This is different. And it's also through Stripe. But that this amount, this new thing that popped up was separate from subscriptions. Subscriptions has already been happening. It has a payout in a totally different way. It's the same way. But it's this is just it's not a lump sum. Okay, cool. So that does actually help that because I was wondering like, man, some of these numbers I'm seeing are crazy. Yeah. Do you want to go? I saw Jimmy, Jim, Mr. Beast posted one. I think you did the same thing. He posted first subscribers. So sorry, Jimmy. But yeah, it was the same thing. It was like $25,000. I think I saw his, so I don't think it's a subscribe. Yeah. So it's just out there. Yeah. So that's like six months worth of. So you're you're looking at maybe a thousand a month. Basically, yeah. So you do the math six months, six thousand. Yeah. I mean, not much to just share your random tech thoughts. Yeah. Everyone's a little. To deal with the annoyance of ads showing up under tweets all the time. That seems like basically, I think that moment on Twitter where it was like, oh, if I am a part of this program, I am incentivized to post more and use Twitter more because I will be paid more accordingly. And anytime that moment happens on a social media platform, that changes the landscape of it forever. Like every time that's ever happened. Yeah. Now to different extents, like when that happened with TikTok, it was a creator fund. And people didn't really make that much money. So it didn't change it that much. But when YouTube got the partner program and started revenue sharing, that inflection point changed YouTube forever. Yeah. So Twitter finally getting this moment. And we don't have any details about like what are our PMs? What are, is it a shrinking pile of money? Is it a percentage? Like what is it happening? We don't really know. But the fact that it happened at all was enough for people to sort of come back to Twitter and start talking about it and figuring it out. Yeah. And there's some cool parts of it. You do have to be subscribed to Twitter blue. But I actually don't think that's that big of a deal. If it's $8 a month, then you're probably going to make, if you're somebody making obviously over $8 a month, it pays for itself. That's kind of nice. The one question I saw people have was it says you need five million impressions over the last three months. And two things here, one, do you have to keep that streak? Do you always have to have three straight months of five million in order to do that? And then I also included this tweet on here, which we'll show on the screen. And I'll read out loud. But someone named John Kraus. So I think we've talked to him for the podcast before. He takes photos of like SpaceX and like rocket launches. His impressions are hilarious when you look at them versus having to have a three-month streak of five million because he goes January 6.7 million, February 5.3 million, March 4 million, then April 74 million, May 9 million or June 4.9 million. So wouldn't hit it there. And then July 101 million. So if that's what it was, he's well averaging over 5 million. But he doesn't have the streak of 30. But potentially doesn't have the streak. I mean, this is a very niche amount of people that this would happen to, but that would be super unfortunate to pull 101 million impression month. I think it should be, I guess if I was going just by the YouTube model, you just have to get the streak once and then you're in the program. Yeah. It would be hard to imagine getting 70 million impressions in a month and just not being in the program like pretty quickly. But you know, it's hard to tell. We don't know. My other worry and I saw this a lot of people saying this is just does this potentially incentivize people to steal more content on Twitter and post themselves versus retweeting or linking to original sources. Like, why would you link to a YouTube video that might not get as many clips when you can clip the YouTube video and upload it yourself? It's obviously going to have to go through a bunch of copyright things now, which I think it already is apparent on Twitter, just not as enforced as YouTube. Now you're potentially making money like, what would you like, am I wrong on that? No, no, I was just like, that's a really soft, there's whole movies. There's like, like the Super Mario movie was in theaters and on Twitter at the same time. Yeah. This is reminding me of like the kick website. They're just like, yeah, man, come over here, stream whatever you want. We're streaming the Super Bowl. I'm like, you guys know that's not going to work for very long, right? They're already starting to now strike all these big people that went over there and are like, I thought we could watch movies. It's like, no, it's not the Wild West. It's the internet still. There's still copyright laws. That's exactly right. So this is why it feels like Twitter, and I've been telling people that Twitter whenever I have any contact with Twitter to like, please communicate more. Like, people need to know what the rules are. And at this point, we don't know most of these rules. Like, on YouTube, for example, we know about the copyright system. We know about how to get into the partner program, what the requirements are. And then once you're in how it works, you get all the analytics and the revenue sharing information so you can optimize whoever you want based on known info on Twitter. None of that is really communicated at all. So these are people to communicate. Yeah. So communication team turns out. But like, this would be super useful information for this whole inflection point to have the most impact. But as of right now, yeah, it feels like, yeah, there is going to be people who just go, oh, more Twitter activity equals more money. Okay, let's just post constantly and steal a bunch of stuff and post more because it doesn't seem to be rules that specifically enforce that. Where one you do define them, then you get better answers. Yeah. And I think like a pretty good example of even past like videos are pretty obvious, you're copyrighted or like audio. It's pretty obvious you're stealing that. But when it's just like a random thought, it's very hard to prove that you were the original of that. And there are people that can just scrape not only Twitter, but a ton of other stuff. We know there's somebody who we know got very popular on Twitter from just scraping Reddit threads about programming. And now is has a very big following and just basically retweets and repost things that are already on the internet already. And yeah, probably is making quite a bit of money from this. Yeah. And I don't know if there's any Twitter copyright system the way you see it built so clearly through YouTube. Like, that's that system that was built behind YouTube. Like took years and negotiation and lawyers and paperwork and like that is built now in a way that it's part of YouTube. I hit to keep using YouTube. But like, hey, it's the S tier platform. So they've got to build. It's figured out. So yeah, this is something they've got to figure out whoever's in that office building just got to figure it out. I was feeling they're just going to wing it till they can't anymore. Yeah, might as well. I'm sure there's also threads conversations probably about this because threads is so new. I don't think there's obviously there's no revenue share program. But when they do start doing revenue sharing or ads or whatever, they got to figure that out too. Yeah, we'll see. I'm interested to see. I am very interested with what Adam said is like when are ads going to start getting onto threads. I guess to wrap up this conversation, I kind of wanted to see how you think or like how is threads been turned into your just like everyday life right now? Because I think that's the most important thing. Yeah. Well, I guess I can it's probably different for everyone. We can probably all just for me personally. It's not on my primary home screen. Okay. It's on one of my home screens, though. Okay. It replaced his Twitter on your primary home screen. No. Okay. It's next to Twitter on my third home screen. Okay. Cool. So it's you know, it's made it out the app drawer, which is cool. And yeah, I open it just for like the same level of entertainment as Instagram. Interestingly, it's not the same content, but it's the same level of I'm just going to scroll for a while and see some fun stuff and piece out. I was in an airport for four hours and just like flipping back and forth. You know, it's just like casual passive entertainment. And once in a while you engage a little bit reply for some threads, talk to people. It's kind of what it is. There's no DMs. So yeah, that's just like surface level what I use it for. Yeah, I'd say my use case on it right now is like I still have that habit of just mines in a folder right next to Twitter, but my my like habit is to just folder Twitter like it's just like such a habit to just like yeah, so I'm so much more hitting Twitter scrolling through Twitter and then being like this isn't great. Oh yeah, there's threads and then going to threads and then looking at that and then maybe replying like once. And overall, my just like my usage of social media that's reliant on text posts has just dwindled quite a bit. There's a question. Yeah. Let's say you you have a bucket of all your social media. Let's say it's I don't know 100 units have your units overall gone up or have you split up your units into smaller pieces. Like if you did like 50 units of Twitter and 50 units of Instagram, are you now doing 50 more units of threads? Are you doing less Twitter or less Instagram to make room for threads? We're the I think I've probably just been using Instagram more overall because it's just like seeing photos and and being more following the people that I know in my like personal life has been I've just realized like man as much fun as it is sometimes it's just like there's so many people bickering and arguing and like it's just more fun to stay away from that a little bit on Twitter, but I mean like it's gonna it's gonna be a thread soon. It's probably already starting to come in there. My Twitter has been and it got cleaned up a little but so bot ridden and I know you guys have mentioned that like there's a lot of that on threads lately. I haven't seen it but I'm just not on threads as much. I would I would say like it goes Instagram, Twitter and then threads, but I'm probably engaging more on threads. But I'm reading Twitter more because I still think that's like a habitual thing that'll be very hard to break and that's and it's so like news based and there's so many like I like keeping up to date with news and that's because people I'm following when threads does that and when it becomes more like apparent and people are on there which will happen. Yeah, I'll see myself using threads more maybe I would like a dim mode on threads. Not the dark mode. I like dim mode on Twitter. Not full black. It is. David agrees with me on this. I know David agrees with me on this. I for some reason it's like blue purple almost. Yeah, like super dark navy or whatever. It's not white black. It's not quite full black. Interesting. Okay. I'm hoping for a little trending topics page on threads. Yeah. That would be nice to. Trending threads, trending words. How you guys using Twitter or threads at all? I've been using it. It did make my home screen. Okay. Mainly because it's the new thing. So I'm just like trying it out and seeing seeing what it's about. But I do like it because a couple of months ago I went through and like really curated who I was following on Instagram. So my Instagram for the past couple months I've actually been having like a decent experience which is crazy. It's good to know that. That's so loud. There's actually like interesting people and creators and things that I like that I follow. Yeah. So when threads happened and it all just transferred over, it's been pretty interesting seeing those people now. I have like a decent, a different experience than Twitter which when it first came out and I like was first starting to follow people. It was all tech people. So like Twitter for me for the longest this whole time has just been exclusively tech people. And now all of my other interests are also on Twitter basically because of threads coming out. Yeah. Before you stop, did you see they mentioned threads is adopting activity, Pub? They're like today. They've been saying that they're going to do that. And they've been like doing their due diligence and going through it. But I'm curious to see when it actually happens. I hope they do because it would be awesome. Yeah. It would be really cool. But we'll see. All right. Ellis. I don't have threads. Nice. At all. No. Don't you have like a other one? Don't you have like some weird fake account on it? I have a Twitter. No, you can't make a weird fake account. Oh, it's just. Yeah. You know what I mean? So like I had Twitter and then everyone's like, oh, Ellis, you got to get T2. And then it's like, oh, Ellis, you got to get blue sky. And then everyone's like, oh, Ellis, you got to get, I was like enough. Threads is too late. I'm done. So, uh, yeah. Outside looking cool. So if you see Ellis on threads, that's not it's fake. That's good to know. That's, that's super huge to know. All right. Well, I think what we're going to do after the break is hype or not. There are no notes out of no idea how to work. I'm going to judge. Which I'm excited for. But before we get into that, we're going to do trivia and then a quick break. Okay. Question two. Do you guys want a tech trivia question or a nature question? Agriculture asking Marques and Andrew. And part of me wants to say tech because when I get the other one wrong, I'll be more embarrassed. So the audience. Let's do a nature question. Nature question. Is this a nature? Is this a specific? I'm still going to get it wrong because the national park question. Oh, is this just nature in general? Let's do that. Okay. So, how many grizzly bears are alive in the world? Jesus. How? How am I going to? Why can I tell you a really cool fact I learned this week? Sure. Does it have to be an hour? Can it be later? Is it really related? No, it's not grizzly, but it is wildlife. Right now. I mean, what is the biggest natural predator to moose? Humans. No. Like biggest. Largest. Size-wise. Largest? Orcas. Yes. Let's do good. Yeah. Moose man over here. What? They swim and they swim up in like the Arctic. Oh, they do. And orcas have been known to eat moose. That's the thing. I don't think it's very common, but it can. That's kind of crazy. All right. That's the best trivia thing I've heard. That's clear. Talk me out. Over the week. Good to know. Imagine being an orchid and being like, do something now that we call hyped or not hyped or over under or hypothetically speaking. There's a ton of names. That was the name. Yeah. Basically, what we're doing is me and Ellis are going to go back and forth and name things in technology, maybe not in technology, mostly in technology. You guys have to tell us whether that thing is overhyped, underhyped, and I'll give you each one perfectly hyped. Okay. So you can use your one perfectly hyped throughout this round. And just be like, okay, yeah, I think that's pretty good. And we have to use the perfectly hype in the scenario. We can't retroactively go back. Yes. Because you want to like kind of save the perfect. Yeah, you got to save it for when you really don't. It's more spicy if you have to use it with fair. Okay. Cool. Okay. So I'm going to start off with an easy one. Red cameras. That's not easy. Are they? Yeah. Like not easy. Because to two different communities, these two very different areas. Yeah. That's I want to get into that. Give me both. Okay. So among among normal people overhyped, agreed. Nobody should get one. Well, they're also overhyped because like so many people are just like, Mark has used a red camera. That's why everything looks amazing. Right. They don't have any talent. It's just the red camera. Right. And like red built their brand up in a way that made that easy. Like good job. Red. You have a strong brand. People see red cameras and go, Oh, wow. Nice camera. But in like the video making community, I think they're, I don't know if they're appropriately hyped or under hyped, but like, I think they're really good, especially for a one person. Oh, as a one person shooting manual focusing camera as far as that goes, I can't get better quality out of any other camera. Me personally. So it is trying to average them. I guess it's like slightly under hyped. I'm definitely not using my perfectly hyped on the first one. It is hard to say under hyped because like, you can pull a lot of incredible footage out of a lot of cameras. And like, it's really hard to be like, Oh, yeah, people aren't giving red enough credit because I think they're getting, I think they're getting their credit. Very obvious they're getting their credit. But like you said, not many people ever need to have one. It's especially in our job. The way we use them. Like we pull thumbnails as a still frame from a video. And it is a 33 megapixel full frame still. That's unreal. Let's forget that from video frames. But I think as an average, I have to say they're over hyped. I think I kind of have to say they are over hyped. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Overhyped consensus. Yeah. All right. That was Europe. This isn't as near and dear to my heart. Okay. Licensed dongles. Like if you want to use some software, you have to plug a dongle into your computer. And I actually have a comment I want to add on this because I feel like they're universally loathed. I've never used one, but I feel like I would hate that. Here's the way I feel it, right? I use a lot of expensive software in my day to day. And I have multiple computers. Right. And I don't want to have to buy that software twice. So as annoying as the dongle is, it does let me multiple computer my stuff, which is why I'm throwing underhiking. That's what it sounds like. I feel like I have this is a little bit different, but on our Netflix account, you're only allowed to download to two different devices. But I've switched my phones enough time that I'm pretty sure there's a phone that has downloaded stuff on it. That's not deactivated. And I cannot figure out. So I only can down. I have to, when I go between my computer and iPad and phone, I have to keep deleting them off of it because I can only do one. So if I just had a dongle that forced me to do it, I would always know where it is. Yeah. SoundCloud does that, but it's my phone. So I don't want a dongle. I don't want to plug in. Yeah. That's the problem. Yeah. Atephone is a pain in the neck. NFC dongle. That doesn't exist, but it's such a pain in a physical dongle, though, is a pain because you always have to bring it with you. And then if you have multiple softwares, now I'm going to look like the middle school janitor of like, keychain of software dongle is walking around. That was me in college. Yeah. I would say this, it would be nice if this expensive software could also just log into more of the one computer at once. So I'm going overhyped. Fair enough. That is the correct answer. Okay. Mine is Twitter like services. So Macedon. Oh, overhyped. Easy. They're all over what? Every single one including Twitter is overhyped right now. Well, yeah, the average would be overhyped. It literally has to be their marketing is to overhyped it. And everybody's. Yeah. Guys over, but they're only overhyped in our communities. Ask your fair true true true. Ask your cousins about Macedon. What do they think? Like, so then in that sense, it's like everything is overhyped except for threads, which is actually pulling out of the tech community and going to the normies out there. But I still think overhyped. Overall, I mean, the other thing is is like all the smaller ones is everyone wants to be like, I have a blue sky in fight. It's so incredible. I was there. I was through everyone. Yeah. Whatever. You just wouldn't know because you didn't get to try it. And that's overhyping. Threads did have a couple of days there where they would put a little badge on your profile for what user number you were. And the cloud that I had was I was like top 1000. And there are people who had like, I was number 13787, 266. And it was like, I had a little little piece of me that was like, yeah, I was I was one of their really people are selling the vanity number account. But they got 420. It's already gone already. It's already and now it's just it's just the threads logo. Just like we thought it would be. Oh, I didn't even notice that. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I guess that I think you have to turn it on though. I think it's off by default. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Either way, they'll turn that on by default very shortly. Yeah. I agree with you. I think they're they're overhyped. Overhyped. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Overhyped. Ellis. RGB lighting. Overhyped. Next. Overhyped. Yeah. I think even like even yeah, even the the crowd that likes it doesn't even really like it anymore. Do we consider these lights behind us RGB lights? They do everything. I believe these are RGB. I see. I think RGB was a mistake. It was fun. But even you look at like think of main gear custom computers, their big ones selling now are like the stealth versions that have like very like the lights are one color and it's only to really accent all the really cool water cooling and like parts. Exactly. So we've definitely gone from the RGB everything like burn your retinas into the like wow, this is a cool like. Supervisor. Beautiful. Even razor is kind of doing it. That $200 or $80 razor mouse no RGB. Beautiful. Mostly for weight saving. But there was a there was an era where a few again, we came a mechanical keyboard because they all had just like you'd plug it in and it would just be like blasting you with RGB light waves for some reason. It's a keyboard. I don't need this. We have an extra five one where it's not even just through the keys is literally the whole base place. Yeah. If you're open to flying to you. You want to see any of your letters. You're just going to see green red and pink lights all the time. Yeah, that was tough. I'm going over hyped. Okay. Tensor G2. Is it interesting on anyone hyping it? That's the question. Besides Google and David. Wow, this is a tough one. I mean, if you're going camping, you got to bring the tents, right? The G2 is better in the that is tough. It's not okay. I can evaluate how good it is, but I don't know how to evaluate how hyped it is. It's pretty good, but it's not that great. Like in the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, it's decently performant and okay battery life. And for some reason, the Pixel Fold, it's quite nicely performant and not good battery life at all. But is it hyped at all? That's kind of I don't know if you're looking at it. I think I'm going to throw it as underhyped because just it hasn't reached the level of us like considering it. Like when you talk about all Android phones, you're like, this has the latest Snapdragon and like Tensor is just such in this category by itself where iOS is as well, but they've had years of making that. So you're used to saying this is like the new A whatever chip and then Tensor is just we've only had two years of it, two years. Yeah. So like, I think it's underhyped, but it's I don't know. Is the, which kind of it's good? And Bionic is overhyped or underhyped. I think all phone chips are overhyped if I'm being honest. I think I could say that the A16 Bionic is underhyped. I could argue that. I was going to say all phone chips are underhyped because they're tiny little computers in your pockets that are doing these crazy things like processing on device, building a voice out of scratch from your own voice, just like weirdly capable. Yeah. And then I see like 10 Qualcomm videos out of why that are like the new Snapdragon video. And I'm like, this is overhyped. Nobody cares about definitely overhyped in those. I think just for law of averages, say, I'm going perfectly hyped. You're using your perfectly hyped here. I'm using because if I say overhyped, that implies that there is any hype at all about Tensor. And I don't think there's really any hype. And if I say underhyped, that would have to imply that Tensor is like better than expected in some way, but it's not. It enables a couple different things that are pretty cool. I mean, the speech to text is super fast and Google assistance good on device. And it does have now playing in the background. I guess that's under. Okay. I'm going to go underhyped. You talk me into it. I think now playing is pretty sweet. I'm going underhyped. Now playing just for that one feature. Yeah. Which only works on Tensor. It literally can't work on anything else. It works on Tensor G1 as well, though. Okay. But I'll stay track and could never. Let's go underhyped. Wait, that was only a G1 feature. G1 and Gen G2. I thought now playing has been on Pixel for a while. Yeah, it's both the Tensor chips. I thought it was pre-tensor, though. Really? I think I might like Pixel 4 had it. Yeah. Now let's just give me the thumbs up. Yeah. Never owned one. Sounds overhyped. So that's not a Tensor feature. I think it's been there for a bit. And it never works when you wanted to. I swear now it's going to say now playing. I think it's so cool. And every time I'm like, what song is this? And I tap my phone to see it. Nothing's there. Okay. So there is something to it. And I have a tiny rant about this. And it is complete speculation because I don't know how this feature works. But if you are sitting in a car and the radio is playing and the song, you know, you change the radio station, it pulls up in the middle. It will listen to the first five seconds of the song and instantly tell you what that song is. And that is amazing. And I think what then it happens is it knows at what part of the song it was in. And it doesn't start checking for a new song until it gets to the end of where it sits. That song would be. So if you were in a four minute song and you pull up in the middle of that song, you're not getting another now playing answer for two more minutes. And so if you're shuffling through radio and you get one ID and then you shuffle to the next radio station, you won't get it. If that's how it works, I want to talk to the manager. I think that's how I love the conspiracy aspect of this is like maybe that's how it works because that's totally something that I would believe would happen. And that's how I realized it. Yeah. And that kind of makes... I think now playing is awesome. I just realized I don't have it on my Zen phone. I've been using it for like a month. So apparently I didn't use it very much. It's good. It's good and ubers. All right. So are you are you into perfectly hyped then if the thing you saw was perfectly hyped. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So you use your perfectly hyped. It still has his. All right. Streaming TV sticks. Is there any I have at all about this? I think it's overhyped because they're pretty much useless at this point. Are they? They're mostly built in the TV, isn't it? Exactly. Well, we're saying I wouldn't consider that built into the TV. I would just not consider that a streaming TV stick anymore. But you can you can you're talking about like a Roku stick that you plug into it HDMI port at this point to turn a non smart TV into a smart TV. Right. It's fine. I mean, most new TVs have the Roku or YouTube or Netflix built in. Yeah. And so if you have an old TV, you plug in the stick and it works. Exactly. I use one for my garage TV that I'm not going to buy new TV for my garage because I really use it and the chances of it breaking out there are it's like a 10 year old TV that I just have a chrome cat in there. Yeah. Maybe I'm just like in a bubble here because my family is always super excited about all of the new sticks because they can like put the Cody on and all these crazy things and do they have an Nvidia shield. I know that's the thing everyone's like it's still like I'm not going to answer that. And I don't really show is is the shield one of the sticks are we counting the shield. People still use that I have friends that use that shield and they love it from all the stuff they've done. People love it. Yeah. That's I don't even know what it is. There's like a shield mod community. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I got to go over hyped them. I'm going to say over. I'm sorry guys. Sorry guys. Sorry guys. I'm sure there are people out there where they haven't bought a smart TV yet but you will soon and it will be useless. Yeah. Good thing it's only like 40 bucks usually. Next one. Widgets. Underhyped. Underhyped. Yeah. Like touchable widgets scrolling on the Apple Watch it's supposed to be coming. Widgets in general are so good and I've seen so many iPhone home screens since widgets have come out that don't have widgets and I'm like guys what are you doing you're missing out widgets are so useful. I think I'm going to use my hyped my correctly hyped one here. I do agree there are some that are incredible but there are way too many that are just so pointless and take up your entire screen and just turn into clutter. I don't get all the new widgets on Mac because you're always going to have windows open and that seems crazy. I think I don't really use widgets that much. I'd rather like have a nice clean home screen. I do think I do agree a bunch of them are great. Widgets on the Mac are pretty dumb. Yeah. I don't understand that but I think some on phones and iPads are like incredible so like by average their perfectly hyped yeah on on widgets for Mac at the moment that they were announced the WWDC massively over hyped. I'm just going to pull up like the optional widgets I can put on my phone right now but like I can't live without my calendar widget on the ASUS Launcher widget cool my authenticator widget actually that might be good. Yes see you're out of luck in the Twitter you just go home and book my code my bank of America widget because I want to send money through Zell in a widget on my phone that sounds reasonable. That's insane. That is insane. That is crazy right the Chipotle widget which just as to sign in to get rewards I definitely need a shortcut on my phone the Tesla widget constantly displays how much battery you have unless you lock and unlock that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I do not need the in-break in widget actually no I love with me see I would look at your widgets I love widgets there's so many good ones I can't I can't go under hyped for widgets because not enough people use widgets I have to go sorry I can't go over hyped I have to go under hyped. I'm just gonna add the reddit is fun widget just because it's still there even though it doesn't work at all. I think I'm just gonna keep what is the TikTok widget oh it'll just like launch you into the TikTok camera right away oh damn you gotta be TikToking a lot to do that okay cool I'm gonna stick with perfectly I don't use widgets well enough so I understand they're there but I can't call them over hyped okay overhyped or underhyped the brown lucid underhyped you like it it's awesome does it's two tone right yeah it is it's the oh no we saw that in California it's the loafers of it's rough it's the loafers I don't I don't think there's that much hype but I'm still going overhyped I think the lucid in general design is underhyped I think people hate on it too much and it does look I think it looks good and in some colors it looks really good it looks like a browning that color though it looks like a whale shark both sides look like a whale shark yeah yeah but so what do you guys go with over hyped over hyped the brown is probably over hyped because if one person likes it then it's over like yeah sorry to whoever is listening to this podcast I feel like the chances that somebody's listening to us in their brown lucid is actually reasonable one that I saw sorry yeah one time if you own a brown lucid just know I'm on your side no okay send us the picture of us playing on your infotainment system handheld gaming consoles over hyped over hyped yeah everyone's smartphone gaming hard disagree smartphone game I think they're actually underhyped right now I think the switch marotted into play and everyone really liked it for a while and now actually everyone's trying to do it and I still think the switch is just doing it the best and the switch is still the only thing I see people I went to the airport and there were I saw two different groups of people with a switch propped up on their suitcases playing Mario Kart on separate controllers yeah the switches I've done that before it's awesome every other one that's trying to be like a hardcore switch is just insanely small demographics the switch is just such a it's the like perfect storm it's like yeah reasonably fun short games you want to play a bunch of or what if your switch could be could run windows and be overclocked yeah and play call like half life three on your it's just not something I'm interested in I am going over hyped or we're gonna get a lot of heat gaugeman for that it's totally fine I agree though I don't need to play counter strike source on the airplane or yeah or just use your laptop or use on the airplane the Google pixel fold I would like to go under hyped it's my hot take is it's not a hot take but it's more durable than I expected first of all yeah and it's fine isn't that crazy I had sand in it weeks ago to be fair I thought it would be broken by now it's the same I went so for those who missed that when I was first testing it when it first came out I went to a three day long beach tournament and I accidentally took it with me the entire time I came back here I put I opened the hinge and and when I made that like a hinge opening movement I could hear sand grinding in the gears of the hinge and I thought this thing is gonna die within days of me getting back here it hasn't guess what I also did on the plane I spilled water on it okay there's a water bottle in the little thing next to my seat when I popped it open it was a metal water bottle for some reason and it like fell onto the phone and it cracked the bottle open and it just started pouring all over the phone and I picked it up and I was like well that's the end of this phone shook it out like unplugged from the charge it's fine it's totally fine that's actually really impressive it cracked the the metal bottle like a thin metal water bottle like what it sounds like the like the photos of like the old volvos when cars would crash into them and then the car would get destroyed because the Volvo is just like a rock that no troubles on on that thing yeah that's the cyber truck this is a cyber truck of phones there it is it's the cyber truck of phones under hyped for sure pixel folds under hyped it's it's expensive I didn't say it was underpriced relative to the time right now it's probably over hyped because it's the most recent folding phone and that is always the most over hyped thing but like no the the the mix magic two came out after oh sorry I guess yeah then I don't know so we're back to under hyped yeah under hyped sure yeah all right next one Hyundai's new design language spicy and you can't get me to say under hyped I love their new design language I don't know just Hyundai just well okay Hyundai and Kia because we said you say under hyped I love them yeah yes so I would wait so no yeah that would be I don't think people are giving I won't say over hyped yeah I I'm very likely to say under hyped I think they're under hyped I think some people are giving them credit I don't think but even like Claire all the time has been and this is even just their EV's some of their just regular cars their ice vehicles are putting out tell you ride they look good man they look great Claire is like wow I really like like I saw a Kia Stinger here and I thought damn that looks like a like a pretty sick kind of fire like I would never buy a Maserati but the Stinger looks like one that I would buy they're both South Korean right I believe so yeah yeah did you guys see the Santa Fe that's 20 24 hours this morning when I was looking yeah we're brand and I in the car concluded it looks like a Range Rover but kind of like there's a very long conversation here about it yeah we had a huge thing I think Alex thought it looks a lot like Darwin's but I think it's more Range Rover style it is a through is a three row right there's no way it's that bulky with only two rows I think it's I think it looks for a three row SUV I think it looks fine I think it looks really good so wait Andrew you're saying I think it's under hyped I do think people are giving a credit I don't think I also think people are giving them credit they look really good and I think they still have the like cheaper brand just behind them but that doesn't mean it's that like it look they look great but also like the car itself is like me so that's good design because the design is so much better than the rest of the car that you are let down by the car which means the design is great that's true but I also think people are under appreciating how much of a moment in time this can be for some manufacturers as they make their first EVs they can kind of turn the corner into being uh into changing their reputation and I think they're doing it at the perfect time they're going to a new high school and they can reinvent themselves exactly yeah people call me Charlie or whatever else name you're gonna make up I don't know why it was at the Santa Fe that's what we're looking at I don't think it's an EV it's just a Santa Fe yeah oh yeah yeah I like tailpipes and stuff it's funny because I'm looking at the Santa Fe out right now and it does not look like it has a third row so maybe this does not but there's not enough pictures I think in here yeah the regular Santa Fe right now does not have a third row yeah I don't know if the new one is the one only has two rows I take it all back it looks like it like it has it has to have three rows also in terms of cars being like man and the design looking good like didn't Doug Demoros say recently that like Prius pretty much every car you buy is going to be fine and at a certain point just by the one that you is that still true with EVs though I feel like it's not truth yeah yeah I would bring it cars yeah true of all the mature regular cars gas cars and hybrids yeah yeah I don't know there's nothing in here confirming that it's three rows so it might only be two but this does look like it has more trunk space than the current Santa Fe Mariah describes the new Santa Fe as quote having a badonc it does is why I think it has to have three rows because if it only has two rows that thing's got a trunk on it but this one's not as bad because some of them straight up look like they have like a saggy diaper like the EV6 I think looks like it has a saggy diaper the lucid the lucid kind of has a saggy diaper yeah just like too much wait EV6 bottom you have the saggy because only because it's got that weird plastic piece that like like is like the corner of it the plastic piece that looks like a saggy diaper okay yeah but yep bro yeah look come on I like the EV6 that's fully loaded baby that piece I don't think it looks as saggy diaper there's just like too much behind the wheel back here you've seen like the porches though that all have that like rear because they're literally rear engine cars and they have all the over the rear axle past the rear axle past behind a rear axle and that like also comes with the look of being like a I don't know if it's saggy but it has the same like rear bias I think it used to be like more high hatchback either like have the whole rounded like the tight diaper filling yeah I don't know these don't these don't quite do it the which is a good thing I also think the the porches since they're using straight sixes a lot of the time it's like they they shape the car around the and they used to be air cooled to that's what I'm saying yeah yeah anyway sorry under hyped under hyped design under hyped design I do like them I still like the key EV6 but yeah I love that all right one more one more are you ready over hyped under hyped yep apple one I don't know what that is it's the sort of it's all solidated so go one same idea it's like instead of the planets instead of buying google storage just in drive you get like storage in photos drive Gmail everything it's like your cloud storage like your one google one account it seems like it's just storage and a VPN I have Google so apple one is cloud storage tv plus music and arcade oh and premiere also adds fitness and news plus and music to not say music I'm if I didn't say music you know if I didn't I read it off a list and severely screwed up so apple one it's just the whole shebang it's in all baby it's the whole enchilada it seems like google one is I'm gonna say under hyped just because I had no idea what I'm also just like not in that ecosystem at all I think this is good I think I generally think streaming services are like people don't realize how much value they're getting out of them and I generally think they're mostly underhyped like youtube premium being 12 bucks a month or whatever it is and getting ad free access to the entire like history of humanities video archive is pretty good I think that sentiment is right and will be wrong in five years because so many streaming services are just taking full advantage and it's all going to turn into this very weird too many of them asking for too much didn't Netflix just eliminate their 999 basic deal yeah so now rather than a basic no ad one device it's only ad supported or the like $15 multi-device 4k streaming version so you get for for $15 a month I think you get up to two devices or like two or three devices you do get 4k and no ads or you pay $699 and you get ads and then you get all of the shows that Netflix has ever made in its history yeah well and I ever hosted ever all the ones Netflix made but like the ones that Netflix didn't make who knows how long they'll be on there and you're in the middle of watching something and then they just go away and even even because it's new streaming service pops up like peacock and takes all the office episodes off of it right yeah I guess I don't know how much of a I don't really watch that much stuff that's not on YouTube but I guess with the ones that I do use they are super super worth it yeah like Spotify as a free me of them like Spotify is great whatever I pay for it might be $12 bucks $15 a month unlimited I tried to I was on a demo device just a second ago playing with something and I opened up the free version of Spotify and tried to play a song and I got a video ad I got a video ad to listen to a song that's crazy so paying for Spotify which I'm totally down for and getting unlimited access to music period is pretty sick I know people don't like paying monthly for things but I think Spotify is like the easiest one it's pretty it's just really hard to not from the user's side maybe use Apple music but just like yeah if you use Spotify you don't pay for a monthly do I pay monthly okay you were making that face like don't look at because I use the the free version for a long time because I just didn't care I would just like let it play and then oh and add whatever and then when I started like commuting and I was only listening to music but it's not it was a problem oh and add whatever it's like my music ends playing yeah but if I'm like boy Spotify bring it right now also don't you you don't get to choose a song in free Spotify um yeah I think you can only pick like albums and playlists yeah that's how I listen to music anymore I just albums but it would be like if I'm like doing my room when all reason it's like I want to listen to like when a new album comes out it's just like you can't listen in order doesn't like oh no by the time ram came out I was already listening I was already paying for it but there's albums like do you know girl talk like their entire album is essentially one song yeah just listening to that out of order sounds yeah or even like the incredible true story it has like a plot one you have to listen in order if you're especially the first time you listen to it you got a you need spot I'd pay ten bucks a month to listen to that album in order that's it do you guys remember iTunes match I've heard of that I iTunes match was the so it was released at the alongside Apple music and they said I had it I was the biggest iTunes matchers of all time where they said it was so complicated it began it was $20 a year and if you had a huge iTunes library which I did I had like a four five hundred gigabyte iTunes library they would take all of your iTunes library replace the files that were in Apple music with like the mastered for Apple ones and then upload all of that to the Apple music servers so you could open the Apple music app and stream your iTunes library from anywhere you were so I didn't pay for Apple music for years but I was using essentially Apple music and and still buying albums yeah damn yeah but now it's gone yeah I think I'm I think we're just landing on underhyped yeah that's what's happening dope good place to end this yeah all right we should get to the trivia we have some trivia questions yeah get those whiteboards all right I wrote down the first one already I'm not gonna change it so I was googling through the internet and I found out you could wake up a computer with nothing but an internet connection and the name for this whole thing was so funny that I I just had to turn it into a trivia question so I don't know why I know this the options are a want that stands for wake on magic packet to clomp like a horse cash load on message packet three stomp that stands for sleep time over mr. pewter and for alarm which is an automated local access revive message nothing I'm ready we're both ready yeah we're both ready three two one oh man we just put different things mark has womp it is womp wake on magic packet bummed no one shows sleep time over mr. pewter but clomp is a really I was like you're not gonna think about clomp there's no way you made that up I've seen I've seen don't know where I've seen this well what's the name of that that Mario character it's like the well there's chain chomp but there's also isn't the large stone one called like a womp it's basically this like flat one with feet and it goes like yeah and like smashes on top of you if he has feet he's womp but if he's floating he's a thwomp okay nice wow that wasn't something new every day yeah I forgot yeah the floating ones like on rainbow road and Mario car and the other ones are in like like Mario 64 and just run around in circles and just trying body slam you how many wolves are there is that the question oh question number two mark has already thinking about it how many grizzly bears are there in the world like what is the grizzly bear population the entire world the entire world and and we need the answer in in kilograms how many kilograms pound zone man yeah I'm gonna be in order of magnitude isn't yeah is this exact number or is this like going over closest without going over okay grizzly grizzly I'm gonna answer and then have a question same oh I'm nervous about my order of magnitude oh okay same order okay I said 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 mm-hmm all right Austin yeah I wrote 10 000 I guess that maybe we don't know closest until David answers which I will be answering what the actual number now the actual number is 55 000 wow oh wow okay so Mark has is closer yeah Mark has will get the point if grizzly bear or brown bear grizzly bear according to world population reviewed okay well ask David what he thinks the answers are both for the acronym for waking up computer be that is be want that is correct to want wake up on a magic packet is the correct answer and for how many grizzly bears are on planet earth 40 000 40 000 is incorrect but it is closest without going over for that question meaning you have taken the point away from Mark has an answer there are approximately 55 000 grizzly bears in the world David that gives you one point meaning you are tied with Mark has no I have two points because I have well got the first question right oh my gosh you have two points meaning you're in first place week one season three trivia how does it feel feels just like every other week we'll leave it at that thanks for listening thanks for watching don't see us in the next one base wait for him is produced by Adam Alita and Ellis Rovin were partnered with Vox Media podcast network and our intro out show music was created by vain so\"": -0.0810435339808464, "{\"\\\" Alright, what is going on? People of the internet welcome back to another episode of the Waveform podcast. We're your host, I'm Marquez. I'm Andrew. And I'm David. This week we've got a whole bunch of variety of stuff to talk about. We're going to talk about Twitter one last time because they're changing their name. I guess we'll still refer to it as Twitter this time. Even though there's still references of Twitter all over it still. I want to refer to it as Twitter for the rest of time. I probably will still keep doing that until it's gone. We're also going to talk about some tech that we've been enjoying lately. And I want to talk about a little bit of a topic that Linus actually made a video about and sort of expand on it. And I think that's actually where I'm going to start. I'm going to start with everyone should watch Linus's one of his recent new videos, which was about, let me look up the exact title because it was pretty, I think it was called, base models are a lie or something. Yeah, like the biggest lie in tech or something like that. Let me find the exact, okay. Starting at is the biggest lie in tech. So like, yeah, base models, you think of like the starting at $200, but there's also much higher specs available. That type of thing is the biggest lie in tech. I went into it thinking he was going to talk about certain things. And he talked about mostly computers. And I think that's what the focus was. The thumbnail was him holding a laptop. But I wanted to like expand on that a little more because I feel like there's, when I watched that video, I just thought like, oh, that's different. Product categories. So in computers, which is what his video is about, he is 100% right. Like the base product, the base product is usually bad. And the starting at price is basically just advertising. Yeah. No one actually buys anything at that starting price. Most people are late. Yeah. I was late. Yeah. They are really early. The Celeron Pixel Slate. We reviewed it. They took it off the market because it was so bad. It's like the sacrificial product that lets them have better advertising. Which is weird because it's usually the worst version of the product. Yeah. But it's not like, usually it's not pixel slate bad. Usually it's just decent enough to qualify. But then the upper the better specs, it's usually really good. In the computer world, it's more obvious than ever. Because like say, take a laptop, for example. You have a laptop that says starting at $5.99. But it'll have only four gigs of RAM and only 128 gigs of storage. And it's like, well, obviously I'm going to be upgrading those things. I don't think you should buy a laptop these days with only those things. And then laptops these days are less upgradable than ever before. Especially if you focus on Apple IK did, you get a laptop that is basically stuck at its exact spec, no upgradable storage, no upgradable RAM forever. So you really are definitely not getting the base spec. So the starting at price kind of feels like a lie because you're never really getting that. But then I thought about other product categories. And the other two that came to my mind, maybe there's others that came to your mind when hearing about this, is smartphones and cars. In cars, it is a complete lie. Yeah. Basically, unless you're going direct to consumer, you basically can't get a base price car. They'll always have the commercial that says, well equipped, starting at $2,999. But the $2,999 is not a real car that you can get. Is well equipped different than starting at? Yeah, that is a little different. But starting at $20, I mean, that's their version of WellClip. That's a different way to like slide you in there. I guess probably because base model is impossible to get there, like, you know, maybe we should stop saying this. Even base model, if you get like, whatever, like a RAV4 at base, a lot of times in different places, they'll have all these packages that are on top of the car. And you're like, oh, I don't want that. It's on the car already. I don't know what you want to do. All weather package. Yeah. And also like a lot of the base versions are missing like many things you would obviously want in a car. I was going to see that say that sounds kind of like a slight to say, well equipped at this price. It's like our base model sucks. I don't know what they're saying. Our base model is not well equipped. Yeah, they can say that. They can say that. Doesn't have to eat it anything. But you can say that when you can never buy the base model. It's they can be like, yeah, those ones you don't want to buy. Also, they're not available in our parking lot, right now. Yeah. So you don't get it. Yeah, it's all about which ones they can sell off the lot. And they're trying to sell things with higher margins. And they don't really want to sell the cheapest possible version, which is often not a good product. Anyway, but then in smartphones though, in smartphones, I think most, a lot of people actually do by the base model. And that's fine because most people weren't thinking they're going to upgrade their phone at any point down the line. So getting whatever, the 128 gig version, if they need some storage, they can pay for that. But a lot of people are cool with 128 gig base model of whatever phone they just bought. And that's totally fine too. So I think that's actually it's different in different parts of tech. There is. I feel like I can almost make the argument that in smartphones, it almost changes a little bit though, because the one of the first things I did think of was the POCO phone. And I feel like when you're getting into these cheaper budget phones, they are kind of doing this weird thing of like, we've seen Xiaomi a couple times do the like, this is the $79 phone that only 200 of you can get. And then it turns into 250, which is. That's almost worse. It's worse. Yeah, but it is different. And like the POCO phone, when it first came out, the it was like, this is the $300 phone, but 99% of people are viewing it, reviewed that like $450 version. That was cooler, which is just like, so I have notes on other versions of this. Yeah, that's one of them where it's like, we, most people will hear that this phone starts at $299, but every single person reviewing it is reviewing a more expensive version of it. That's one thing that happened with the POCO phone that usually happens with computers. They don't ship the base version to reviewers. And then the other version is when you see the lineup on the website of like, all the different specs it's capable of. I think like take a Razer laptop, for example, that you can get like a 120Hz display or 4K display. And then it's capable of like, up to 12 hours of battery if you have the worst display. They will list up to 4K display and up to 12 hours battery. Next to each other, as if you can get a machine with both those things, but that doesn't exist. Totally. That's another thing that happens all the time that drives me crazy. Yeah. So as a reviewer, I try to say how much the thing I'm reviewing costs and sort of evaluate different pricing tiers. And should you get the base version? Should you get the version I reviewed somewhere in between? Here's what you should upgrade. But yeah, those two things drive me crazy. Yeah, I want to step back on the laptop or computer versus smartphone thing again. I had a wild story with my sister. And I think I told you guys this, when the M1 or possibly M2 Mac Mini was out, or I guess M1, there was like this deal where you could get the second storage tier, the 256GB option, which also came with a little bit more RAM, I think, for like $50 more. And that deal came out two days after my sister bought the base model. And so I was like, I'd message her and I said, if you can, you should return yours and get this for $50 more. And she was like, why? And I was like, I think you're going to have this spec forever. It's twice the storage. And she was like, what do I need storage for? And I was like, wow, there's so many people that I think it's hard for us to see outside of this because I cannot imagine having a laptop of 128 gigs of storage. We like make videos that it's like two terabytes for a project. I'm like importing footage right now. But that was a laptop, right? No, that was the Mac mini. Okay, sorry. So it depends on what you're going to, what people are going to do like that with that computer. Right. So the 128 gig version exists. And theoretically, there's a non-zero number of people who are totally fine with that. I think there's a lot of people that are totally fine with that. Yeah. Like if you look at the iMac, like the on one iMac, I would bet you that most people bought the absolute base model. That's why they didn't upgrade from M1 to M2. Yeah. I think when you look at what Apple sells in the stores too, like if you go to Apple.com and go to like a pickup and you expect something out, especially like a custom computer with certain RAM and certain storage, you'll always see a longer lead time for anything that's not the base model. But if you spec a base model, it's like, yeah, we got these in the stores. In the store. In the office of the car, right? Yeah, it's exactly the way. Yeah, yeah. I think it's also that that would be my argument for why higher end smartphones make sense to buy base models because like most of us have cloud storage and stuff like that. We're not storing a million things on our phones. So like, yeah. 64 still feels kind of low, but I think a lot of base models now come with 120. Yes. And like that's totally reasonable for a phone. And a lot of times phones, you're not cheap. Obviously there's some outliers, but you're mostly just upgrading the storage for like a non-base model. That's the pretty much. That's totally fine. Like a base model is a great, they're great price for a lot of people. Yeah, it's interesting. You don't really see phones where you're just like, well, this model is 60 hertz. And if you get more storage, you also get 120 hertz. You have to go to the pro. Okay, that's interesting because it's different phrasing. It's kind of the same thing. Like if you just want to buy the iPhone, the base model is just the iPhone 14. And then you can buy the 120 hertz model, but that comes with more storage and different materials and stuff. And a different name. But it is kind of like the base model. But then it's like a different size and you have different camera phones. Right. It comes with an extra camera. It comes with a bigger higher refresh rate screen. Those I would say most of the companies are usually pretty good at differentiating that, but when you come to carriers in the US, I was going to say it before with like Samsung. I hope you like get the S23 starting at. And it's the like regular S23 price. But when you're looking at that, like that guy's probably going to sell you on like the S23 ultra. That now is at least the plus 700 more dollars. When you think about it, that's really smart from Apple to make the regular iPhone 14, the exact same size as the 14 pro. Because then sure you're getting a worse screen. But like every other company, if you get the pro, the screens bigger. And that like sucks for a lot of people that don't want massive phones. ROG phone. What about? There's a couple ROG phones, they're all the same size, but the pro is like a nice one. Well, that phone is probably the most computer-like phone. Yeah, a Jason. It's like a laptop, a Jason. Yeah, where when you upgrade the specs, you actually do get an overclock CPU and extra RAM, extra RAM, which you know, but he really cares about in phones anymore. You don't need 24 gigs of RAM on your phone. Yeah, that seems like something everyone should have. But it is actually pretty wild that people don't really need 128 gigs of storage on their phones. Yeah, I don't think so. I know how much storage you're using your phone right now. I could, well, I just started using the Pixel 12. I could look at my iPhone. I checked recently. I'm at like 212 gigs on my iPhone, so I could not do the base. 212? Yeah, I could not do the 128. And you don't think you could make room. If I didn't, so when I fly, I listen to music and it's all offline downloaded already. So if I blasted my whole Spotify library, I could probably get under 128, but I don't want to. I'm currently using 158 gigs, so you couldn't use the 128. Yeah, I mean, if you really wanted to delete a ton of stuff, but that's, that's no sacrifice. I would get the second, but honestly, yeah, it's because I download a ton of YouTube videos. I'm looking at the biggest storage things. I have 36 gigs of YouTube videos downloaded. Jesus. That's, that's, that's easy to claim. I know that's so easy to claim. It's easy to claim. I fly a lot and I download like 30 videos. I do. I download them on the runway and I like hold my phone up to the window and like download some YouTube videos. Yeah, you gotta just plan an hour more ahead and it's so much easier than to like, please download before this takes off. Yeah. Second is podcasts of 23 gigs. And then light room. Light room, I only have 12 gigs, which is surprising. I feel like most people have like their photos and videos are the most. I have huge files because I transfer full camera images to my phones. I usually edit photos on my phone because I know that that's exactly how people are going to see it. For sure. So yeah, I could do one. I have 113 gigs used. 41 or an app somehow. Don't take anyone for taking us. Yeah, but it is crazy. I could take this pretty easy. Remember the time when everyone had the 8 gigabyte iPhone and people were running into storage issues all the time. Like my mom would only ever upgrade her phone because she couldn't take any more pictures. I'm pretty sure that that's the number one way that people run out of storage. Because other than that, like unless you download a bunch of offline files, whether it's music or movies or whatever, that's going to be your biggest files. Like if you have an iPhone Pro and you just turn on pro res by accident and shoot a bunch of 4k pro res, like you're going to cruise through a couple hundred gigs. If you want to be really tin foil hat, you could just be like, well, they're making these super high resolution 100 megapixel sensors now on phones because the storage is way higher. And then you have to buy the higher tier or the better cloud storage. Yeah, they do a good job of like, binning it down. Like they're not actually good. I think another number's sell. And like you can buy the pixel has a 48 megapixel camera, but you literally can't shoot for the 8 megapixel images. Yeah, it would like all bins down. But yeah, they're trying to give us a good experience, I think at the end of the day. So ideally, you know, compression. It is, I just want to say one more time, I would never buy a computer with 128GB of storage. No, but talking to my sister, I'm realizing how many people would. That I also agree on. Yeah, I think you're totally right with like the iMac. I mean, think of like Chromebooks also. Yeah, a lot of people re-reasing, they buy Chromebooks is because they know all that they do is really look on the internet and do stuff. So like, why do you need storage to browse the internet and watch streaming? Okay, so a question for everyone. Is there a piece of tech that you think you could be totally fine living a lifetime with the base version of? Yes, it's called the iPhone 12 mini and I've been doing it for years. Do you have the base base model? Base base. 64GB? Is that 64GB? Oh, that's cutting it close. Are you close to the top of 64 enough? I was until I updated to the iOS 17 beta, right? Somehow wiped 20GB of system files off of my phone. If it works, it works. We wiped them off. Yeah, like before. Just make some space. I didn't find out. It's just the common importance stuff. I had been juggling my last six gigs for a year. You know what I mean? And things were starting to not work. Nothing involving my voice worked. Voice to text didn't work. Siri would never even load. Forget it. It just exploded the models that was like, I can't. There's no more storage. I guess so. But with the beta and all of my new space, she lives. I also, I just want to say, I was talking to Hiyato, but this is maybe unrelated, so maybe it won't make it. But I accidentally slammed a glass bottle down on the screen of this phone and the glass bottle broke. To be even just, the iPhone is so rammed. It's sealed. Did we just talk last episode about a bottle hitting your phone and then we're dending the bottle to the pixel. The pixel fold dented the metal. Yeah. Wow. Those are times. Fones can beat drinks pretty easy. I will say a ton of people by the base model air pods. Even the old air pods with the long stem, I see so many people that still have those. I actually see way more of those than AirPods Pro. Are they the base or the USB-C ones? They're not letting you USB-C ones, right? Or sorry, lightning. I meant, you're all f**king that up. Well, the old base ones were a headphone jack. That's where we're going. Wait, you mean that you're going to... Just cut all of this out. Cut all of this out. I don't know if I could consider AirPods base model because you can't upgrade it. Those are ear pods, I thought. No, AirPods. What are the wireless AirPods? We're not talking about ear pods. I wouldn't say that's a base model, because you can't upgrade that version. You could just get a better... You're saying like the Gen 1? Like those AirPods and AirPods Pro. Yeah. And AirPods are one thing, the base model and then the... You can upgrade to noise cancellation. And now you have a different... But they're also a different shape, but it's a totally different product. But you could make that same argument for like... Regular phone versus a pro phone. All interesting. How many parts of the boat do I have to take off to make it? Yeah, but the boat... Well, no, I think the pro phone... There's still a base model of a pro phone. I think that... Well, but it's not the pro phone. The other two different models. For what? Yeah. So do you think... The iPhone example, where you have the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 plus, iPhone 14 pro, and iPhone 14 pro max. All of them have a base model. Okay. That's true. Okay. You're right. That's true. That's right. But I think also when you walk in the store, a lot of people go, what's the new iPhone? Yeah. And they end up with the base model. I feel like you mentioned that before as like the step out of the base model. I was like the thinking of it as a bigger picture. But I would still consider, I think most of our listeners would consider each of those having a base model. It's just storage. I think the same thing happens with AirPods. Like people walk into the store and they just say, I want AirPods and they buy the cheapest AirPods. I agree. Yeah. It's... Maybe not technically right, but I think that's how people think about it. And people do that, yeah? We're getting into semantics. It sounds great. I know people listen to this podcast, or like that sound them saying, what do you mean you just walk in and say iPhone? But when you buy the store and listen, you're like, oh my god, they're just asking for the iPhone. Yeah. And they have nothing else to say. Yeah. It's crazy. Uh-huh. It's crazy sometimes. Yeah. So is that the base model, Adam? Yeah. What's your phone? I live on base models all the time because cloud storage is a thing. 128. Less than that I've done in the past. 32. No. I also got to say something that hurts is when you're trading in phones, less and less they ask for the storage that you're training in. So it's like, Really? On Apple at least does not ask for the storage tier. So you get the same amount for a 512 gigabyte iPhone 14 pro than you'll get for it. Well, here's the dirty little secret. It doesn't cost them a lot to add more memory. They can charge you by the charge. This was the crux of Linus' video. Oh really? In case you haven't watched it, I mean, you should watch this video. It's really good. And it's a learning experience. But that's the number one thing that he talks about in his video is the amount that someone like Apple charges for eight more gigs of built-in storage versus the amount of extra cost there is to Apple is it's like a 300% plus markup every time. I will say that's very different than it used to be because I remember buying my first iPod and it was like the option between like eight and 16 gigabytes of storage. And back then storage was really expensive. They still upsold you on it. But it wasn't like today where like like memory is the cheapest possible component. Yeah. I just think it has definitely stratified over time. I remember speccing my computer back in the day when I built my HP Pavilion DV7T on HP's website. Old. Yeah. I know. But it was like going from. For RIMs. So when you went from four to eight gigs of RAM, you went from 32 to 64 bit Windows. And I remember looking at that and then looking at other computers like that you could buy and how much they charge for next four gigs of RAM. And it was very consistent across the board. And now it's like, if you go to Apple, it's literally like $200 more dollars to bump up your RAM. That's watch line says video, but that's the main point of it. Storage is the highest margin thing. Do you guys have any base model things that you can live with? Yeah. I think I would be able to live with a base model Ruby and R1T. If given the check, that's not the base. I think I could live with the base one. The dual, even the new dual motor one. Whatever the cheapest model. The base model is just a gas truck. That I have a whole lot of. The R1T now has, they're now shipping the dual motor version. So there's the quad motor launch edition and then there's the base model. But those, I think when you look at like Rivian and even Tesla, there's so few specs that they're kind of all very similar to the base model. The base model, baby. Base model is great. I'd be fine with one. Yeah. That's fair. That's fair. I would say my car, I could do the base version. Of the flat. Of the flat. Oh yeah. The long range model S. Long range model S is a base version. That's true. Yeah. Oh yeah. The fact that it's long range. Do you get a wheeler, you know? You get a yoke still. Oh yeah. You can option a wheeler, I believe. Or might be bad. In my case, I think it's a wheel now and you can option. Sounds like the base model is better. Well, that's the question. Is that I guess that question becomes is the model S the base model or is the model three the base model? Yeah. I think the model S is different from the model. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. All of the base models are fine. Yeah, the model has a really bad base model. Model S is the model 3 pro. Imagine if they called it that. That's the person who just walks in and goes, I would like a Tesla. Which one? So the model Y is the model 3 plus. Yes. And the S is the model 3 pro. It's got more storage. And the X is the pro max. It all works. That's true. It all works out. It's perfect. Yeah. I would like a car please. Here you go. Yeah, here's the model 3. It's hard for me to figure that out. I'll have to do more thinking on that. Because my entire life basically has been very much like if I cannot afford the version of it I want, I will just wait. Like I'm not I'm not bad about needing to save up more money to eventually buy the buy things though. I also do not buy this almost ever. I guess that's another question for you spends to like what upgrade isn't like what are you just okay with on it. It just doesn't matter to you. Not that you're saving money. It's just because you don't care about generally like clothes. Well, it's just I didn't mean in general. I'm not thinking like in tech is there an unnecessary upgrade that you make anyway? Like you don't care about like you're not going to spend money because I get what you mean by you want to spend money for the thing you want. But is there something you're not going to also spend an extra $200 to upgrade something if you don't care about that. Right. So is there something which I'm sure you'd have to think about for it? I have to think about it. Pretty much every upgrade we make is because we really want it. Yeah. And like we're spending extra money to get it. I think that's a good thing to live by also. Like if you want something that's expensive and you really want something that right then you can't afford it's way better to just wait and save up for it because then when you buy the cheaper version you're just going to be sad with the thing you spend a ton of money on and then that's something. That's a lesson I learned from my mom when I was like nine because I wanted a toy and I bought the cheap version and it broke within like a week. And she was like see how do you just wait? Do you have the two weeks of allowance? You deserved it. You kid Adam deserved that. Let me tell you how I have trauma. Let me tell a really quick existential story. Okay. Existing. Yeah. When I was in fourth and fifth grade we had every week we would get points at the end of the week if we didn't like get in trouble right and have our card moved or whatever. Classic fifth grade. And on Friday afternoons we'd watch a movie and you could either spend some of your points. I think we get a hundred points a week and it was like 50 points for a candy so you could buy two candies or you could only spend half of them or you could spend none of them. And at the end of the year we had an auction where everyone had to bring in something from like the thrift store or something and we would like have an auction to teach kids how auctions worked. But fourth and fifth grade we had the same teacher so you could keep your points over into the next year if you wanted. Dude I'd be saving this. This is like good life lesson. 34th grade. 34th grade at the end of fifth grade. Like what am I getting? I'm just imagining I'm just imagining I'm just imagining for a Tesla. Yeah. I'm imagining fourth graders at a thrift shop buying things for. No so literally I didn't spend a single point for two years because I was like I'm going to go to that last auction I'm going to get whatever the crap I want. Yes. That's me. So that's what I did. But, it's about school. It, I ended up buying like a pda that I didn't use and then I get away. It's the most David answer. Of course we did. Yes. Yes. But the interesting life lesson in that is that I did have to think about like huh. It is worth like having small amounts of happiness throughout your life right? Like maybe I should have gotten some candy every now and then because I felt extremely powerful going into that last auction but I felt really empty when I bought the pda. Yeah the pda tasted disgusting. I have a theory. This is a theory. I love that story because it reminds me of I have a theory that there are basically two types of like video game players. If you're playing a first person game you know you can kind of like go through the game and upgrade little bits as you get more vc or whatever you like. Oh I got enough for the thing. I'll buy something. Oh I got enough for something new. I'll buy something every single time and then there's the other person who's like I'm going to get as far into this game as I possibly can without upgrading a single thing. How I'm going to go to the absolute limit of this character then I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to dominate and I'm going to buy a ton of stuff and I'm going to crush this level and I'm going to go 40 more levels with this exact setup. Right. Grind super early. That is my setup. There's this roll through the game. The other version of that is like do you play the game straight through the story mode and do all the bosses at like the lowest level of XP or do you do every single side quest so you just walk up to the last boss and f***ing like one shot in second. Yeah. Because you have so much like so many stuff. I like saving it. I get I get some value out of like saving it. So like if I can save two more weeks of allowance and get Aegee's ram on the laptop, I'm doing it. Yeah. There was a time in Pokemon Gold where I upgrade or I evolved my Sintaquil into a Typhlosion before I even left the first town. So I just rolled up to the gym leader who had a level six. A Gen 1 only. What? Gold is amazing. I knew it was amazing. Best game. I had a level 36 Pokemon and destroyed the gym leader's level six Pokemon. It's really fun. In NBA 2K there's a storyline. It's probably similar to Pokemon but literally you go through college basketball and then you go through early overseas pro leagues trying to get scouted and you try to get as far as you can without upgrading any of your skills and you're just a bum on the court and you can barely score but you're barely holding on and then you get to a cutscene where it's like sorry, son, you're not good enough to start. Oh my god. Wow, I need to get better. Then you go to the store and you buy all the skills and you max everything out and you come back and you just are a god on the court. But it's so fun. I always feel like it's going to feel better than it does. Like when I destroyed that level six Pokemon with my level 36 Typhlosion, I was expecting it to feel amazing and I was just like, this feels kind of empty. I can look them on these better. I can tell you why the other side sucks. Strength animation. In Pokemon, I use my master ball immediately. What? And then when I had to catch me too, I was in total panic forever because I was a kid and I was a moron and I was like at my friends, I was almost crying because I didn't think I was going to get into. Do you remember what you used the master ball on? No. Probably not. Probably like a better free or something. It was probably something stupid, like a cipher or something like that or it was that. This is what I feel like when you guys talking about sports. Just don't know what a master ball is. Yeah, use my master ball on Wayne Gretzky just like to make sure neither of you understand this conversation. Anyway, we're pretty off the rail. Yeah, I think it's probably time for you to have a free. Anyway, take the base model as far as you can and then spend what you think it's worth. Use your master ball on the first level. Trivia time. All right, so according to motor one, what was the best selling car of Q1 2023? Oh, I know the answer. I think I know the answer. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. In the US, in the world. In the world. I know the answer. World wide. There's an article about this. Yeah. I don't. I love this question. Me too. 20 club. I know it's not the fiat because apparently they only sold like 20 of them in the Q1 in the US or something like that. I want to get this one. They're just fiat. I'm going to give you the company. You're going to even hints. I think we can all get this right. I'll give you hints. You don't have to give me. We'll do it at the end. Of course. I'll just get it wrong. I'm fine. All right. All right. I do need to catch who you have the most fun time. No, David has the most fun time. I'll give you a hint. It runs on gasoline. What? Actually, that's a good one. Wait, really? No. No. Oh, OK. That's a key. That's a key. That's what I assume. That's a massive hint. It does it. It's the hint. Oh my gosh. OK. We'll be back after the break. Oh, we were still going. Kruger, fresh for everyone. All right. Welcome back. As we were on our little ad break there, a little appalensite or article actually just dropped. And David, it was on your feed. So why don't you reveal it to us the way you did literally 25 seconds ago? OK. I think it's interesting. Let's pretend we're on ad break. Yeah. Reenactment. You guys are talking about a car. Lincoln avigator. No, Lincoln pickup truck. Lincoln pickup truck. Same company. iOS 17 code, hands-in action button. In iPhone 15 promo. That sounds still. Play a man. Action buttons are sick. Yeah. But it's also very unappable like I was immediately reminded of the remapable Google assistant physical buttons that we used to have on phones. OK. You can remap to other stuff. Yeah. There's only a few phones that have custom remapable buttons. There's only a few phones with extra buttons at all. Not at all. Sony has a shutter button, like a camera button. You can launch the camera and take pictures with the specific dedicated camera button. But there's a few phones. I want to say Asus has done it. A couple phones with an actionable, like a custom mapable extra button has done it a lot. Samsung's. Yeah. You can remap now, right? I think so. But I'm pretty sure you can. It was only Bixby for a while. It might only be to Google Assistant. I think it might be just to Google Assistant. There used to be like the Zenfone, I think six. It was seven. Yeah. They always used to have this just extra button you could do whatever you wanted with. Yeah. Which is sick. It's sick. It's very Android. Yeah. On an iPhone, what would that action button do? Because right now, the only thing I can think of, Apple Watch Ultra has the... What does it call? Action button. Is an action button? So you can kind of map a few different things. You can start a workout. You can open a certain workout with that button. What would an iPhone action button be able to do? I was worried. I was like, is this only going to be for exercise but on your phone? Like, that seems a little bit weirder. But in this article, it says that it might be able to do open accessibility, camera, flashlight, focus mode, magnifier, shortcuts, silent mode, translate or voice memos. Shortcuts seems dope. They're going to see the new features. Shortcuts would be awesome. If you could map it to a very specific short cut, that would be amazing. Siri Shortcuts is the best possible case. And even then, it kind of feels hacky. Because like, if I wanted to open a website, it would be like, all right, hold on. Let me launch Safari, type it in, refrat... It has to kind of go through a process. If Apple does this, I can imagine it being neutered and like, you can only do a certain set of eight things with it. And five of them are dumb. Like, change your focus mode with one button. Yeah. It's already like, it's so easy. Like, okay. The Muse Switch, by the way, on the iPhone, is like one of the smartest things they've kept around. Because not a lot of phones do that. One plus had the alert slider for a while, but like, just that quick like switch to mute. Yeah. It's so... That's been great. We love that. An action button I would want to be able to launch whatever app I want. Yeah. Let me just pick an app on my phone and launch it. Yeah. I don't think they're going to let us do that. Probably not. Which is a bummer. You could probably do that through shortcuts. Yeah. Yeah. Technically, yes. Yeah. And it would take like an extra second. Yeah, an extra second, but it would like the action button on the watch. You can map through shortcuts and have it do a bunch of things. Oh, really? Yeah. That's cool. So if they take that same thing and put it on the phone, I would imagine it would work similarly. I wish it didn't feel so hacky, but that is true. Yeah. It does eventually pull it off. It's... There is a lot of cool stuff, but yeah. Whenever I watch Quinn do things about shortcuts, it feels insanely hacky, but it's still kind of cool. This is cool, too. It says the action button may also take over the volume up buttons, duties in the camera app. It could activate the autofocus when lightly pressed, while a firm press will take a photo, far resembling conventional camera buttons, and a hard prolonged press will initiate video recording. I think they'll do that. That's dope. Because if you could just start recording a video instantly from your lock screen, that'd be really cool. I can't imagine the half press working. That sounds... It would have to be... It's probably a solid state button, which means it's like a half-dick button, sort of like the... Right. Which means... Would be experience phones have something like that? The Express Shutter button has a real half-shutter button. It has a half-shutter button. Yeah, you have a press for autofocus and then full press to take the shot. What is it autofocusing on that it's not all red? It has... It's acting like an alpha camera. So it has continuous autofocus. So it just hits what it moves something around, and you just want it to make sure that... It wants to do that. Because the sensor is so big that it actually has natural depth of field now. Yeah, it just feels like most phones like are autofocusing on something, and then you have to tap to pick something else. So how a half-spirited, too. So a half-touch of that doesn't necessarily pick what you want. It's picks what it wants, I guess. The Sony experiences, you can tap a certain autofocus point, and then autofocus with that point with the camera. It's just acting like an alpha camera, basically. So it's a little more advanced, it's cool. The iPhone... I suspect won't do all that, but it'll be cool to see an action button. Will they make it orange? This is a question. Yeah, that's a good question. I want it to be a certain color. I hope it's from the phone. I can't wait till it's just Siri. No, the power button's Siri. They can't do that to me. They can't do that. What if the power button powered the phone off? It does, but now you have to... I know, I know. Volume up. Exactly. Or volume down one at the end. God, it was just a Siri. It was a bad joke. It was a hard read. That would be the worst thing ever. They went back to power and then made that Siri. Unremappable Siri button. That would be awful. There was a major rumor that the buttons were all going to become solid state, and then that rumor went away. So maybe this is where that rumor started from. This could be an extra button that is solid state. So potentially it's all real buttons, but this is the first haptic button. Or like solid state button. And then they see how well it does, and they can judge how close they are to making all the buttons haptic. Yeah. Makes sense. You just let like 10 Apple leakers get a freebie off their wrong prediction that they got. Yeah, I mean, the rumor score is like 75% possible it says. So this could be totally wrong. Interesting. But, you know, we don't... We kind of rarely do rumors on here, but this one seems kind of fun and interesting. I'm into it. Yeah. I'm into special colored buttons on phones too. So I'm kind of hoping for that. I doubt that they're going to make it orange because the only reason that's orange is to be like a dive watch. True. Yeah. Make it red. Apple. Please. I think there's no shot. There's an accent color in zero. The brands are going to have a field day with this. Neon. Okay. Let's have a moment of silence for Twitter. And because it's no longer called Twitter technically. Technically. Depending on where you look. Depending on where on the site itself you are looking. It's been officially rebranded to x and it's x.com. And it's x is... And it's x videos, that's not true. It's just x related things. There's an x logo. The little bird is retired. Makes you wonder about all the people who bought the bird statues when they sold all that stuff. I wish I did. Yeah. Little birds that go. I don't know that I'm going to call it x. I'm still calling it Twitter. Like I think when I say it in public to a person. I'm still going to call it Twitter. I don't know how long it's going to take to catch on. Probably a long time. So you're saying you don't want to follow changing one of the most household brand names. In existence. In existence. It's got your to me every time a well known and at least decent reputation brand gets killed. H-B-I. Why? That's so just max. Like everyone knew that brand. Not that everyone used Twitter, but everyone knows what Twitter is. And to try to start that over, but with some sort of like, I mean, it's like meta. Like we all know what Facebook is and we're not calling it meta. But that product is called Facebook. Yeah, they at least did that. Yeah, it's a product. It's a product inside of a brand. It's like alphabet for Google, right? There's an umbrella company. And if they just made x the like parent company, which they did, they did make x corporate x warp, then they can keep the Twitter name. Then they can keep the Twitter name. Yeah, but they're just shafting it. I have two theories around this. Two possible theories. One, Elon is actually trying to do what he said is he's trying to do, which is basically to create the wechat of. Oh, he said that already. Yes, that's what he says, but he keeps me say, you know, I mean, that's what he's been saying forever, whether it. Yeah, he's talked about making the x app forever. When he was making PayPal, he tried to rebrand it to x and he got ousted. I think he likes to let her x. Yes. A little bit of it. A little bit of it. SpaceX sounds cool though. I'll give SpaceX. SpaceX sounds cool. That's cool. Yeah, they couldn't just call it SpaceX. Or like, I guess. But my other theory is that he's trying to basically bankrupt the company, but in a way that doesn't look like he's trying to bankrupt the company. Because if he bankrupts it, but he has like plausible deniability that he was just trying to make it better, then he gets out of having to pay a lot of money. So that's a hell of a... I mean, I like it. It's a hot-earned thing. He still owes like two-thirds of his net worth to this company. Yeah. But I think someone like that is more motivated to prove everyone wrong. Yeah, actually make it the everything app, which is the complete opposite direction of bankrupt. I think that's what he's trying to do. I think there's very, very little chances that happening. Because there's plenty of people who would love to own the app that controls everything in the world. Like, why wouldn't you want that? But that's a stretch for a website where you can just be really mean to people on mind and 280 characters. And you can make a lot of money off that. Yeah. I mean, there are starting to roll out ads. Obviously, we talked about them doing creator payouts and then sort of adding some creator features. And that's at least progress in some direction. But yeah, it's like, it still says tweets all over the website. Like, what's going on on Twitter? It says Twitter all over it's still. If you go to x.com, not logged in, there's a giant button that says join Twitter. Next to the x logo. So there it is. I just don't understand. It's like, I mean, I think we can all agree that it was probably like they were going to do this. And then Elon was like, do now. Yeah, or we'll announce is it. And then everyone in the side was like, oh, we are not ready for this. Yeah. Now they're slowly changing. By the time this episode comes out, maybe they'll only be like seven instances of Twitter still on. Then like the hundred there are right now. But it's been changing a lot this week. It's just so insane that Twitter has its own lexicon. There's, I tweeted this Twitter like, like every it's the thing you want to create. A quote tweeted. There's sub tweeted is like a thing in culture. You know, like, there's all of this stuff. And like, no single brand, except for like Google has been able to like make its thing a verb. Yeah. It's like it's so hard to do that naturally. That like why just like burn away. Seren wrap. I mean, well, yeah, there's a lot of us in short band-aid, Kleenex Qtip, like, that's our verbs. I Qtiped my ear. I won't say that. A swab my ear. I don't know what to say. I'm going to Seren wrap this. True. Yeah. But it's like you just burning all of this like naturally occurring lexicon that everyone would die to have. Is that what are you like strive for? Arguably the most valuable part of Twitter. Yeah. Like when you talk about the most valuable brands in the world, a lot of time it's like what is Coca-Cola other than a couple formulas and some sugar and a bunch of ads? Like the brand Coca-Cola and the mind space that it takes up in most humans like knowing about the thing is the most valuable part of the company. Yeah. And that's true about a lot of the biggest brands, kind of like Nike, Jordan, Google. And I think if you were to argue like what's the most valuable part of the dumpster fire that is Twitter and their headquarters, it's probably their brand value. And to just nuke all of that and call it something totally new that let's be honest, our parents are not going to call it X. But we don't really know which is like what he paid for. And also it's like what he paid for. That's exactly that's the crazy part. He paid actual dollars for it and nuke to the most valuable part of it. Yeah. He didn't really pay for the users because like he did, but there's not that many people on Twitter compared to like a lot of other things. There's one more people who just know about Twitter. And like the Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimmel. One of the mean tweets thing. Oh yeah. Like that everyone knows what a tweet is. Yeah. That's so. Also you go to you go to any newscast or sportscast or anything. Twitter doesn't pay any of these people to have their logo on the screen. They just put it on the screen. That's a free. And imagine how many like companies and stuff that have billboards or signs on buildings or trucks that are going around with like Twitter logo as their list. Or no, just the Twitter logo to go to their social. And now all of those are. Yeah, every food truck in the world. That's the other thing. Every food truck has like an Instagram logo, a Facebook logo, a Google plus logo. And in Twitter logo. Now two of them are dead. And that's just unfortunate. And it's just the SEO of X also like is terrible. What are you this for you type Twitter because you knew what it is. Now it's like X find them find David ML on X like what is going to show up on it doesn't sound Google. What David and I know X X X. Doesn't sound great. This is the only reason why I have that like kind of theory that he's just trying to bankrupt it to get out of the payments because like it seems like the most illogical thing that he could possibly do. But maybe he's a genius in world idiots. Who knows or maybe it's just a bad move and he made a bad move. I think that's just it. Yeah, but I think it's not a bad move. I think they could go back right now. I agree. I think there's just bring the bird backs. People agree to them that it was a good move I guess. And I'm sure there are plenty of people who agree with it. You on around him. I feel like well, and that's not just you on that's every billionaire. Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm bummed. Oh, I'm really bummed. I really hope that things change in the next like a couple of weeks and it goes back. They'll change. I mean, it's just it's a day by day thing. This is like the fourth week we're talking about. And what we're saying now we record on Wednesdays. It could be totally different by Friday. Imagine it's Twitter on Friday. It's back to Twitter on Friday. I don't know, dude. It could be Google on Friday. You know, Twitter plus. I was I was thinking what if what if meta rebranded threads to Twitter? Well, I said they should just call it why. I made that joke actually. I said people are always talking about X but nobody's asking why. That's funny. But Twitter is available now. Twitter is available. If threads became Twitter, it would be like it would be like the Charlotte Hornets. Yeah, like the Hornets went to New Orleans, became the Pelicans, got the Bobcats, and then rebuked the Hornets. Yeah, they should. Yeah, T3. Threads is T3. I'm going with that. All right. Does that make Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Jordan? In the Hornets example. Yeah. He just sold though. Jordan just sold the Hornets. So what does that say about? Look at you. Mark, okay. It would be funny because Mark Zuckerberg has wanted to own Twitter for like ever. And if he ended up owning Twitter, just not the original Twitter, it would be really funny. So I guess, but the thing is as much as we all talk about, Zucker not wanting to be all using apps where Zucker has all of our data, he's kind of been the most successful for as much copying as they do at social media stuff. In general, there's a, I watched the, it was a clip from the Lex Friedman interview that he interviewed, Zucker, about, I don't know, a bunch of stuff, but there was a clip where he literally asked him like, okay, what do you think about what Elon is doing with Twitter? And the answer was really interesting. I'll link it in the show notes so you guys can watch it. But he was along the lines of like, Twitter is an idea that could have a billion users. They just never had the execution and the business savvy behind it to actually get there. And there's no reason why Twitter shouldn't have a billion users. A public town square is a good idea. Like, there's a lot of the things there that make a lot of sense. It's just for whatever reason, Twitter was never able to execute on that. Elon's still trying to execute on that. And then there's some teasing at the end of like, would you do your own thing? And then he was like, what, I don't want to say. But, you know, this is like a month before threads launched. So we kind of all read between the lines in hindsight. But I think that's the zuck thing is like, we'll turn this idea into a billion users. It is interesting. I read a lot of analysis about why Twitter became such a thing that it is. And apparently, it's, well, what a lot of people have said is that Jack Dorsey really had no idea what he wanted it to be. So he just sort of let kind of the people on Twitter create Twitter. And that's why it became like successful. That's why Reddit was super successful. And now they're like, just kidding. Yeah. Screw all that. Yeah. And obviously they get into like weird stuff. And like, you could say that Elon also wants Twitter to just run itself. Obviously, you get into weird moderation issues. And that's like the biggest issue with social media overall. But yeah, I think a lot of people are saying threads, even though it seems like it has a lot of potential, they've specifically been saying like, we don't really want this to be like a news and political place. And it's like that's going to become a thing. It's been weird that they're not embracing the clear, like you need the power users. You need the 1% of people who post the 99% of stuff. And a lot of that is the like fast moving. Like, there's an earthquake right now. Now you all know about it before it even hits you. There's news now. There's things happening. That's like the engine of Twitter. But the thing is like Facebook, right? Like Facebook went through all of this stuff where everyone was like, you're the arbiter of truth now. And so they went through like this insane like congressional hearings and all this stuff. And they don't want to do that again, right? They're so terrified because threads is not even that different from Facebook, right? The only difference that thread has to Facebook basically is that you can follow whoever you want. And Facebook did eventually add that feature, but they were too late to it. So now threads is kind of just like Facebook 2.0, but they are really scared of being Facebook 2.0. Because if they allow this kind of like political thing to take over, and then there's like election interference or whatever, and people like yelling at each other, they really don't want that. So they're trying to put notoriously not the person you want in charge for. Yeah, exactly. It is really interesting to watch the types of things that the algorithms on threads incentivizes. Because you can't just stop people who are being political or newsworthy from being on threads, but you can surface other things more often. And that encourages that sort of behavior. Positive stuff. Positive reinforcement. Yeah, not on. So you kind of have stuff. I assume that when we see things on the homepage, by the way, they introduced a following. Yeah, finally. In the most Instagram way, I'd sort of talk the way I know where to find it, but it's there. But I think they're going to be showing people the stuff they want more people to post. And so when I see the, when I load up the homepage on threads, I'm paying attention to what types of things they're showing. It's a lot of text-only posts. Yeah. It's a lot of people's reactions and actual threads happening. Yeah. Not so much videos. I can't remember the last time I saw a video on my threads homepage. Yeah, so just. Yeah. I would like for threads to be able to replace what Twitter did for me, which honestly was just news aggregation was the biggest aspect of Twitter. There was random, fun, friend interactions and stuff. But the biggest aspect for me was we drop links in the slack all the time. I do go to the verge every day and read all their articles, but I'm not on every single news website every single day. So Twitter is a really great news aggregator. And it's great because if you're mentioning the verge, the verge posts a ton of articles, but the ones that are popular, that are the ones that people are interacting with on Twitter, and then popping up in my face. So it's basically a free way of being like, these are the things people are more interested in. That's what maybe we should talk about this week. It helps us write the podcast. So I would like threads to serve that role for me, but by default that is news. So it's not like political news. I don't think they're going to get away from news that much. It has to get there eventually. It's even be kind of competitive with Twitter. It also needs a web app because it needs a web app so bad. Oh my God. You heard us my phone all the time until like fine news. Yeah, you heard us already with we want a following tab. Thank you kind of. And please give us a web app. Please, please, please give us a web app. I'll leave you with this as food for thought to think about what threads is what it's trying to be, and what we already know Twitter to be. When you open up Facebook and go to the box to post, you know how there's a little bit of a prompt there already, Facebook says what's on your mind? When you open up Twitter says what's happening? Question mark, ice cream mark. That makes a difference. Question mark, ice cream mark. What's happening? What's only that? That's always, for as much as we talk about like the conversations in the public town square or whatever, I always just think of like when we share tweets in the slack, it's like this just happened. This just happened. That's what tweets are. Right. What's happening? Instant. What? Exorcitor. Literally we talked about that Apple insider. It was like posted 30 seconds ago. It was a tweet that we found. Because it just happened. This just got found. I actually found it on threads. Well on threads. On threads it just says start a thread. Oh wow. So that's not a great strategy. Start a conversation. Threads is a start coffee. Cool one man. Start a thread. Just relax. I'm not going to check Macedon or T2 right now. I'm just going to leave you with those. And we'll say threads has a 500 character limit which is nice. Twitter blue people that have more than 200 characters. That's great. Twitter needs to change the way that this works. Because when you hit show more, it brings you to a whole nother page. And sometimes there's only like three more words. And then you have to hit back. I saw one recently that it was one more word. And I was really mad. My gosh. It's just like the waste of my two seconds. They should expand in line. Obviously. Yeah. Why don't they do that? If they expanded in line, it would be amazing. Maybe they want an X's work on it. Would you buy X blue if it did? No. There's nothing we could do. X blue. It's still called Twitter blue, by the way. On the website. It actually is. Funny enough. If you click on the Twitter website and you inspect element, the X logo is labeled Twitter. No. And that's a perfect place to end it. Yeah. That's the state of it right now. Trivia to add break. Trivia to add break. I like sound of that. Yeah. What letter is X in the alphabet? What letter is X now? Quick. All right. 24. Wait. Really? For you, right? 24. Nice. Okay. So we make fun of Sony all the time for their crazy wacky know-to-no schemes. Oh, no. For their naming schemes. Everything about Sony. You might be perfect. Yeah. Okay. I make fun of Sony all the time. But I would say, for example, for item hates K-pop. The headphones, WH1000XM4, but that's a long honored tradition with Sony. For example, the headphones that came with the first ever Walkman was called the MDR3 and was part of the H-AIR series of headphones or hair. Yeah. Crazy. What year did those headphones come out with the first ever Walkman? What is the tradition bad naming? Pretty much, yeah. Oh. I thought there was going to be, I thought it was going to be like the something 1000. So it's like headphone. What does 1000 mean? I don't know. It's just their model. It's just that, yeah. Why is it there if all of them are 1000 means W-H is wireless headphones? One with WF is wireless earbuds. I don't know why it's F. Phonics? Nope. Phones. Nope. You were close this the first time. It's true wireless. What? Yeah. F. That's TF. T-W-U. No, yeah. Wait, it's just F. So why is it WF? You were. What? No idea. You just said it's so much SNF. I just don't get why it's WF, W-H, and then XM model. Like number of it is. What is the XM sound? All of them, I'm even fine with the XM. What is the 1000 for? It's free press because we're talking about the sound. So that's the trivia question. That's true. Okay, so basically what you were in the Walkman come out and ask the question. Basically. I know that. You're really? Yeah, he did a whole episode on the Walkman. I was hoping he wouldn't remember though. I was hoping he was a whole by a year's end. I hope I remember correctly, but I do remember. You want specifically. Yeah, he wants exactly. Do you remember that? I know a year. He said the year. I'll have a year. All right, we'll be right back. All right, welcome back. We got of course some new Samsung stuff to talk about. They've dropped their new Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, S9 tablet series, and watch six series. Our impressions video of the phones is up. I don't know if you guys are interested in the others as much. I am personally very excited about the S9 Ultra tablet. It's hilarious. It's one of the most crazy pieces of tech I've seen. I'm wow. You opened it this morning. This is a Tab S9. We just heard you giggling from your desktop. Just feels like a monitor without a stand. Yeah, the Tab S9 Ultra. It's a 14 and a half inch, $1,500 120 Hertz tablet. I felt you did that last year with the S8 as well. I did. And it's nuts. It's just as nuts. It's just as crazy. I love it. Just holding it. I'll hand it to you. You'll hold it. You'll be like, this is absurd. Okay. It's great. I'm ready. But the phones, I'll just go over real quick that the stuff that's new. Because they are relatively minor. It's quick and easy to summarize. I'll put it that way. The new Fold has a new hinge. It has a new brighter inside screen. And it has a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. That is all that's new. You should definitely have a lot of thinner. It's a lot thinner. It's so because of the new hinge, the entire form factor folds flat and gapless, which is nice. And that also does make it a little bit thinner, flat. I think open is the same. And I believe it's the same size battery, same cameras, same charging speed, same screen size, same aspect ratio, same resolution, same everything else. But you know, chip, hinge, brighter inside screen. That's it for fold. Then you have the flip, which is the same set of things. It is a new chip again, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It's the new hinge again, folds flat. And instead of the brighter inside screen, it is a bigger outside screen. That cover screen. It's a 3.4-inch cover screen now, with literally access to any of your apps. They're basically matching what Motorola did. But it's got a little bit of a cutout around the cameras instead of enveloping the cameras. So this is the Samsung way. It's a little bit safer. But you can do up to, like, there's 12 widgets now on the home screens. You can flip around, go through notifications, do more stuff on the outside. Watch a YouTube video if you really want to. You can do any of the stuff you'd normally do on the inside, just a little more access on the outside. So you don't have to open it as much. That's it. That's what's new. I kind of said, and I kind of proposed this like theory in the video that Samsung is very settled on these form factors. And the more I was playing with the fold after I've recently used the Pixel Fold a lot, I really want like a wider passport size version of what Samsung's built. And I don't think that they would do that in this phone. I think they would just make a whole new phone. Yeah. I think they would just make a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip mini or whatever. Z-Pasks. They would make a new phone. Or something. Exactly. So they didn't do that. So I'm using it. I'm demoing it. I'm remembering all the things about this phone that I like and that I don't like. And that number one thing is still that it's just like a tall, skinny candy bar. It's weird to type on. I don't like watching YouTube videos on it. Nearly as much as David, you tweeted this morning, you're using the Pixel Fold on the outside screen a lot. Me too. It's the best folding phone to use closed. And I think that's what I sort of miss about, this Samsung phone, which is state of the art. Incredible displays. Very solid cameras. Okay, battery. Like it's a solid phone, but I just wish the form factors a little different. And I don't think Samsung's going to do that. I think there's an interesting comment too on Twitter. Keeping the screens the same aspect ratio for developer continuity potentially, so that they can have the advantage of people continuing to make the most apps for their phones. Maybe, I don't know, but that's the new Samsung stuff. Can you use any app on the outside of the flip? You can. Okay. And you can sort of flip a switch to enable. Some will look ridiculous. And the labs feature. Canon should, I guess, are different. Yeah, yeah, you can literally go through the checkbox and same with Motorola. You can just like check the box of like, let me use maps on the outside. And that's actually kind of useful. Let me use YouTube on the outside. You can be a psycho. Cool. Sure. So you can do whatever you want. It's just some may look a little more ridiculous than others. Dang. I think my favorite thing from Unpacked was, and it's not something we want to use, but I just like that they brought back the classic version of the watch in the Galaxy Watch 6 with the like actual physical turning dial. I thought that was really cool on the four. They didn't have it for the five because they had the watch five pro, which had a bezel, but it didn't turn. And then bringing this back, I think a lot of people are pumped about that. Yeah. And it's a little bigger screen, a little thinner bezel. But yeah, if you can do anything with that, like it's a UI, like it's like a digital crown. It'll still move around. Yeah, the UI with it. Clockwise, scrolls down, kind of clockwise, scrolls up, that sort of thing. Yeah, and it protects your screen. Which is nice. Just having that lip is nice to have. Exactly. And then the S9, the Galaxy Tab S9 series. S9 tablet, S9 plus tablet, S9 Ultra. It's 14.5 inch tablet. It's literally almost this big, just holding a touchscreen. 120 hertz bright, 15 inch screen in your hands. It's crazy. It's wild. It's going to snap it up. I'm looking at the half again. Oh, 100%. I was looking at the Samsung website. And they make looking in their ecosystem look very good. Like, I wonder how it would be to spend a week just living with only Samsung things. This was a take that I cut out of the hot takes video. Or I think I threw it in the intro maybe. Somebody said, Samsung's ecosystem is better than Apple's ecosystem. Whoa. Better's a strong word. Better's a strong word. They're also just as good. They're just different. Like, there's just different products. There's no washer and dryer in Apple's ecosystem. There's just different things, right? Yeah. The Samsung smart things and encapsulates a bunch of stuff. There's no smart speaker yet. It's not canceled yet, technically. There's no smart speaker like the HomePod. But I think you could live in Samsung world pretty easily. You could look in your fridge on your tablet. It's pretty cool. Yeah. You've got the nearby share stuff with the computer and the phone. And they have a lot of... They do have a decent amount of proprietary stuff that works with their devices. Yeah. They got really good earbuds. They make laptops. You can use a Samsung Chromebook. You could have a Samsung monitor. You could have a Samsung Windows. On your Samsung laptops. There's a lot of stuff that they make that all work well together. That's true. That's very true. So you could live in that ecosystem. Samsung phone. You wouldn't necessarily have a... Well, you'd have to use Bixby. So... I don't really use voice assistance that much. You don't really have to use Bixby. They let you use Google Assistant now, don't they? Yeah, I guess if you were living in Appleworld, you'd use Siri and if you were living in a Samsung world. They'll only live in that world. Yeah, yeah, fully in it. If you want to commit. But it is an interesting question. They of course all think about ecosystem all the time. It's just one of them's notorious. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting to see the Samsung Flip versus Razer situation and how people respond to that overall. Yeah, I think that's the same phrase. Yeah. This is a $1,000 with the Razer $1,000. Thanks so. Razer Plus. Okay. It is worth noting you have to download a good lock module to be able to run any app on the home screen or on the front screen, whereas on Razer it's out of the box. Oh, for Samsung you do? Yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Okay. But they do have 12 widgets that you can do. There's like a fitness widget and a clock widget and a bunch of stuff. And it looks generally pretty good. I think that it's interesting. Samsung over time because they have wanted to be sort of the Apple of Android and they have simplified things. We've talked about this a little bit with like you know, the S23 phones are pretty much like the default NPC of smartphones now of an Android smartphone. Like what is the absolute base looking Android smartphone? That's an S23. That's like the person that walks into the store and goes, can I have a phone? Yeah. Even for more direct. Specifically, it doesn't want Apple. They're going to get a Samsung. I can't tell you how many people are like, I have a Samsung S20 or like Samsung 20. Samsung Galaxy. Not like Samsung. I have a Galaxy. Yeah, or that. Galaxy series. Yeah, yeah. But like, I think that the reason that they're not doing the same thing as Razer with like the cameras in the screen is because even though Samsung does do a lot of like experimental stuff, like they started the whole foldable revolution, right? They now are settling into this point where they're like, we just want to play everything safe. So let's make the cover screen not go over the cameras. So everyone knows exactly where the touchable areas are. Exactly how this is going to function. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. They'll probably run with this size display for the next like four years. And the size phone. Yeah. For a while. I do. Yeah. Like you said, I really wish they would make a passport style fold because Samsung could knock it off the park. The candy bar for me is still too awkward to use. And it makes you want to open it more often. Whereas like, yeah, the pixel fold, I'm really enjoying. I use it. I'm just going to use it. It's one of it's incredible. I get why Samsung would rather be though the phone. People enjoy more what it's folded out. I don't do you want to be the phone that's more fun to enjoy closed? Or do you want to be the phone that's more fun to enjoy doing the thing that you're paying $18.00 for? That's fair. There's advantages to both of them. There's different. Yeah, exactly. I don't think they're dying to be the phone that's more fun when they're closed when they put so much effort into being the folding phone. Yeah. Yeah. There's just the battery implications. Like, it's kind of, it's got to be at least good to use. Yeah. Samsung also has really, really good trade-ins for their own phones. Someone noticed me today that the full, the Flip 4, you can get $900 for a trade-in on Flip 4. And if you're a student, they have 10% off. So you can literally get a Flip 5 if you have a Flip 4. For basically free, you just have to pay sales tax. Solid, which is insane. And be paying a university to be a student? Yeah. True. Yeah. Then you deserve a detail. Or using your old student ID. We don't get done that. Yeah. A small university. Yeah, their trading's are crazy. I'm really debating doing a Flip 5. Paying like $100 for a brand new phone. Their trade-ins are nuts. And it seems like if you're trading in something that folds, they give you like a very, very good price for it. Yeah. Is that a red flag? Yeah. Get those things off too. They just, I will say, I was in, yeah, I was along the Pacific Northwest coast this whole last week. And I stayed with some random person from Instagram who I didn't know at his house. And he's amazing. He's great. Shout out to Abel. But he had a Flip Gen 2 or Gen 3. I think a Gen 3. And the entire center part was cracked. You know, not in a way that like he dropped it in a cracked, but like the crease cracked it overuse. And he said that that was his second model. And that he had used his insurance to get a new one because it cracked the same way the first time. And he got a new one and then it cracked the same way again. Yeah. And to be fair, that was like, I think that was a Gen 2. So hopefully the screens have gotten better now. But I have seen things about people's foldables cracking. I think I'll still always press it about everyone that he's ever owned. Yeah. And it's kind of crazy that the outrage over that has like died down so much because I used to be a really loud thing whenever one thing would go wrong with foldables. I think we know it comes with the territory now. Yeah. It's crazy. I think that's a good segue though. That's a good segue because our last segment on this week's show is a little bit of show and tell. We're going to talk about some piece of tech that we've used lately or that we want to share that we think is really cool. I'm just telling people about it. I'm going to go first because the segue is I have been very impressed with the pixel folds durability. Just because I, you know, there's like a, it's a notorious thing that these phones are supposed to not last very long. I talked about this last week on the pod. Pour water on the phone, took it to a beach, all these things. It still makes the grinding noises when I open it and close it. And it's fine. It's totally fine. So just shout out to the pixel fold now. I also want to talk for a quick second on Sony's new WF 1000 XM5. So they're out. There's an app now. So we get to test some. Dave's got a pair too. These are the earbuds that are basically designed to sound amazing and be worse at everything else that earbuds are good at. Like they're not supposed to work out in these. They're not supposed to sweat in these. I thought they had an IP rating. They do, but like you wouldn't get these if there's these are not workout headphones. Yeah, I would get so many other pairs of headphones other these for $300. They're like those headphones that are also 300 bucks. It's like, yeah. But I will say they do sound pretty good. It's really good. And they have new processors and they have a new smaller form factor. Now that's the main thing I'm happy about. Just because. Yeah, I wouldn't. The biggest challenge with these is they're always huge. They're earbuds and they sound amazing and they have great noise cancellation, but they're always huge. And these are smaller. And I'm happy about that. And they wireless charge on them. The bottom. Yes. Instead of on like the side. And I noticed that too. Pop it on the charger like that. I love it. It seems like they realized that the Link Bud S, which I love, was a great series in a lot of different ways. And they're like, let's make them the better sounding version. So that's my show until what do you guys have? It wants to go next. I have the current mouse I'm using to play games. This is the Pulsar X2. This is the random Frank P version. Which you're gaming with a wireless mouse? Yeah. No, I've been gaming with a wireless mouse for a while. Okay. I've realized my mistakes. But I was using that crazy like $300 razor Viper mini signature edition. But it was just too small for my hand. And after a while, this, I have to say for 95 bucks, which is a great price for a wireless mouse. It's not any more expensive to get the like, they worked with two different creators. I said this is random Frank P's. Same price. Cool design. It's been a great mouse so far. I'm like dominating my premiere matches in Valorant with it. So you know, it must be pretty sick. But yeah, I just like it a lot. It fits my hand really well. And I think it looks sick. Cool. Cool. Would you say it's better than a magic mouse? Don't answer that. But yes, I have one and a half things. So yeah, I know. I don't know. All right. I'm just going to, the first thing I'm going to like tease a studio video. I have this 3D printed film camera. Oh my god. That uses an iPhone as a viewfinder, which is very cool. Why don't you say you can't buy this? Can people buy this? You can buy this actually. Yeah, there's a yeah, yeah, yeah, working out the kinks. But like there's a few, yeah, there's a few tech angles to this. And that's why I'm making a studio video about it. Can I say what I love about it quickly? Yeah, just looking at it. I love that since it's on the, it doesn't have a normal viewfinder. It still has two levels on top to make sure that your level the one that's on it. It's built into it, which is cool. That's really awesome. It's a camera obscura. So it doesn't have any wires in it whatsoever. Which is really awesome. I've been making some really crazy photos on this from various trips. There's a studio video coming out about it within the next like, we can have to two weeks shooting film shooting film. I was going to ask to hear the shutter sound. I can show you the shutter sound. Oh, is there a film in this? No, I can show you this. It's probably not quite as. Hold it up to the mic. Yeah, do you want it to be one set? Yeah, we'll do one second. One second, bold. Oh, I didn't cock it. That was one second. You can also do like one one 25th where it's a lot faster. Solid clunker. It's in the lens. So anyways, yeah. Cool studio video coming out about that in like a week and an half to two weeks. The main thing I kind of want to talk about is actually software. Which is exactly what happened last time when I talked about ARC browser. Which by the way, ARC browser is officially out version 1.0. So shout out to you guys. Yeah, I can finally recommend it now. You don't need to download a browser. Yeah, you don't need to invite anymore. So go download it. It's the best. But the main thing that I want to talk about was this app called Beeper. And I used to write and make videos for Android Authority. And I've used Android phones my basically entire life up until I started working here. And then it was sort of like on and off. I was like on an Android phone sometimes and on an iPhone sometimes. The thing that's like using an iPhone at all for any period of time will do to you, especially when you make friends who are not in the tech space. Is you start gathering people in your life that force you to use iMessage and that are rude if you don't. In the United States, this happens nowhere else. I still have never experienced this. Yeah, it's because you haven't used an iPhone for expanded period of time. Get an iPhone for like three weeks and you'll see that you guys will be nicer friends. No, I agree. I agree. It sucks. But there's an app called Beeper. Which the point of the app is to actually aggregate all of your messaging clients into one window, which I don't actually like the idea of that. For some reason, I'm a segmented kind of person. But you can log in through your Apple ID and you can use iMessage on your computer and on your Android phone. And it works really well. It has basically all of the regular iMessage features. It's got voice notes. It's got replies. It's got tap-backs. So for me, it's great because I can finally use whatever Android phone I want and not have people get mad at me. It's not worse than Twitter Blue Use. It's wolf. Yeah, I know. People who complain that you didn't have the answer. It's so dumb. And it's only probably an excuse. But I've been using the Pixel Folds. I really like it. So Beeper is very cool. I think you still have to sign up for a wait list. I think I tweeted about it in the developer. It gave me a code. So I'm kind of like. Just try that. I just tweeted the developer. Just like our browser. Sign up for the wait list because it's actually really good. Do you know what does that that doesn't have a wait list? What's up? Yeah. So here's the thing about it. When I logged into my Apple ID because you have to like log into your Apple ID for it to work, I got a notification on my Mac that said an unknown device in Kazakhstan has logged into your Apple ID and was this you? So I don't know exactly how they're making this work. It could be on some old iPhones. It could be on a physical old Mac. It could be on a virtual Mac. I don't really know. So I don't I just have to remote into your computer real quick. What I'll say is I took the privacy risk. I like it. But do it at your own risk. The Cardi B clip of her just being like, that's suspicious. Yeah. I've been enjoying it. I think it's really you deserve to get bullied. I'll try. I'll look in this with a hot taste. I'm sorry. I actually prefer the context switching of different messaging apps. I do too. I use the notification shade as my unifier, but I prefer like when I get an Instagram DM. Yeah. Interacting like an Instagram DM. Yeah. And then when I get a text into interacting like a text, that's just me. Not everybody's like that. But if you like it all in one place, there's an app I can try. I don't want to use the reason that Bieber exists, which is to integrate all of your messaging into one place. You just after the iMessage part. I just use it for the iMessage part. Okay. Because I can run on a Windows computer, I can run on an Android phone. Yeah. For me, that's great. But yeah, I wouldn't want to like message in Slack in a Bieber wrapper. Right. That's weird to me. Yeah, it sounds like well from the office, just everything gets put into one space. And you get sent a million different notifications. Yeah. I guess it's the opposite. But so. Anyway, that's that's my pick. What about you guys show until? Okay. So I'll let Ellis go last because his is dope. Mine is this. I'm on the six A again, just for reasons got bored. But they have a teenage engineering pocket operator app exclusive to the pixel. That's really cool. Really? Yeah, it's really dope. So like, yeah, it's similar to the nothing like beatmaker thing. There was a lot of like teenage engineering. Yeah. But it's that. Hmm. So it doesn't make your phone light like pixel exclusive app. No, that's a rare one. So it has video also. So you can record video and import samples and things like that. That's funny. So earlier today before we recorded, I went into top-down room and recorded a little beat. And this is my beat. And then you can add things. Yeah. I can play these kids with video. So you can see in my face. Oh, that's what you're trying to my thinking of. Mark. Oh my god. Mystery guitar man. Mystery guitar man. That's what you guitar man. Bro, well, that was it. That's my choice of throwback. That was fun. That is such a throwback. I don't know what that is. Wow. Shout out to Joe Pena, old YouTube channel back in the day, Mystery guitar man. Just look it up and you'll immediately watch that know exactly what we're talking about. It was like, I remember when he sort of like hit the scene, it almost felt like this like next level of production quality for YouTubers. Because people were still just sort of like iMovie being their way through skits. And then he was like, it's not even that crazy. But it was just like, it's just I have a thing. I have a thing for like when I can tell that a lot of effort was put into something, I really enjoy watching it. Yeah. And when you watch his videos, you're like, oh, this took forever to make. Wow. Yeah. Shout out. Um, my thing, if you, I put a link in slack. I mean, not in slack in the show notes. Because no, not in the show notes either. In the Google doc, put a link in the Google doc. Of this thing that I got because it's kind of hard to explain. It's just a link called Ellis's thing. It's a link called Ellis's thing. But essentially about a month ago, I found a listing on eBay for a factory sealed Roland V4 EX, which is like a 10 year old video processor that like sits on your desk and it's about the size of a shoe box. And they're easier to find in Japan if you're willing to import them. But I had never seen one factory sealed. This looks like a red means recording video. You should make more of these. You like my little unbox. I like it. Yeah. I was not going to unbox it. Uh, so I'm part of a discord of people who like these sort of things. And I like dropped in the discord. I was like, you know, I just got like a factory sealed one of those. And everyone's like, dude, record yourself unboxing it. And I was like, I'm not trying to like flex on anyone. You know, but they were like, no, we want to see like what it's like in the box. I'm about to give them this 4K. That was my favorite part of the story is you're like, I didn't want to flex on the people in the discord by doing it by like doing it unboxing. And I was like, so you're now filming it on red. I know. I'm just a love red footage. I don't think they know I work here. So I think they were just expecting me to be like, with my iPhone. They definitely are. I'm, but this thing is really cool. And I'm sure I'll talk about it more. Can you give us a quick example of what you would like to do with it? Or like, uh, uh, I have no idea what this is. It's nothing like an afterburner. It's only 10 years old. Yeah, it's only 10 years old. It looks older. Yeah. It does. Um, 2013. It does a lot of different things. But if essentially you can plug a bunch of video sources into it like four specifically. And then it has a bunch of, uh, transitions and keys and wipes and, uh, diffusion effects built into it. And then it has like color processing. Um, it has different like feedback channels. Uh, what does it do? Picture like the year is like 1995. I know it's like, well, that's why I'm saying this looks way older. Yeah. So like picture like 1995. And you have like a big stack of home movies that you recorded. And you want to like put music behind it and like transition between them. You would use something like this to like edit it all together without a computer. But I use it to make pretty pictures. Nice. Well, this is good. This is, this is a good show. I think I should do this more often. Yeah. As soon as we all have something else cool to share. It's nice because like we don't always get to do the most, the latest tech thing. But there's probably something everyone has that they're like, I kind of like this, but we're way past the release date for it. Yeah. Or just randomly if anyone has anything cool to share, we'll just do one person show and tell him, yeah, it'll be fun. With that all being said, we should answer the trivia questions. All right. That was so weird in the unboxing video. Alice posted. He lifted the trick. The, thank you. The lever as the music went on and I thought my computer started making. Whoa. All right. So trivia answers. A quick correction by the way, a couple weeks ago, I asked you guys, what was the first commercially available smartphone with wireless charging? No one got it. So it doesn't affect the points at all. But I said the Nokia 920. A couple people in a discord hit me up and were like, actually, it was the PalmPreet from 2009. I saw a lot of comments about that. Yeah, but the PalmPreet, this is why I didn't choose it because I was debating it. Smartphone. The PalmPreet, you needed to have a different backing and a different charger. You had to buy those separately. It didn't come as the thing. But it was available to buy. So I'll say it was correct. The different backing was just backing that wireless charging could go through or it physically had the company. I hone in. No idea. I think it was a, yeah, it wasn't like a Moto Mod wireless charger on the back. I think you just put the coil in. Yeah, it was like a completely different backing. So, correct. I'm not sure. I didn't affect the scores, but yeah, that's the answer to that. First question, though, comes from Ellis. According to Motor One, what was the world's best selling car of Q1 2023? Oh, you're right. Already. I think we're all good. Yep. Wow. Anyone want to read it? Or Tesla Model Y? Tesla Model Y. Tesla Model Y. Tesla Model Y. Tesla Model Y. To me. To me. To me. It is the Tesla Model Y, which sold 267,000 units. If you'd asked me, I could have gotten close to that, too. Because I had to do a lot of research for the best selling cars when I was talking about the F-150 late now. And I know how many Ys and Threes are sold. So many cars. And in a year, they add up to 1.2 million. And it's about 200,000 each per quarter. It's a fun fact. Wow. I got to say, I rented a Model Y for one day when I was in San Diego. And I don't really understand why people like being high off the ground. It's very much the number one thing people want. It's crazy. It's crazy. Yeah. I think today I thought it felt so heavy and I don't know. So my question was, Yeah. Basically, what year did the MDR-3 headphones from Sony come out? Three. MDR-3. Wait. Oh, yeah. All right. Which is basically what year did the Walkman come out? Right. Also, while we're waiting, quick update on the score. Marques with two after that correct answer. Andrew with one after that correct answer. And David and the lead still with three. Will he hold onto it? Or will Marques catch on? If we all get it wrong, will the person close to get a point? How about that? Wait, that's very close. This without going over. I'll say you can do outgoing over a year. Why not? Sure I can. Do whatever I want. It's very trivial. I think that's so much harder with a year on how long ago it was. Yeah, I would have guessed. Because you're generally aiming probably towards the close to a dream. Do you want to sit at the table for once? T-Shay. T-Shay. You're welcome. I'm in read. You're welcome at the stable anytime. I went seven, three. David and I went very close. I think it is the eighties though. Wait, can you read it out? I said 1973. I said 1971. I said 1989. That would give the point to David. Oh, baby. Wait, you are doing the closest? Yeah, I'm doing close with one over. I just made that up. 1973 is what David said. The year was 1979. So you were the closest. 79, the original walk. Even if we didn't go without it. No, it was closest to their way. I almost said 1988, that was my close. The original walk. Came out in 1979. The very first one. Yeah. I know that we associated it with the eighties, but I figured it must have been the late seventies. Yeah, I probably want to. Well, obviously, I'll give you that came out in 1989. Oh, wait, no, that's the... I think you're doing the yellow one. I'm thinking of the Nintendo Game Boy came out in 89. Yeah. 89. My bad. I thought of the wrong thing. Okay. That's fine. I'm not mad. Thanks for watching. Thanks for listening. Thanks for sticking with us for a little bit of trivia, but also a whole bunch of variety of topics and some show and tell. We'll be back with you next week. Be sure to like, comment, and subscribe and re-ex this video when you see it. See you guys later. Peace. Bye. Wait, from his Bruce by Adam Alina. We're partner with Vock. Whoa. That's what you get for making fun of me in the trivia. Wow. Or I just forgot. I love that you made direct eye contact with Alice. Immediately after you're like, by Adam Alina. Wait for him to be spied on Alina and Adam Alina. And Adam Alina's side face. Yeah. Oh my god. Wait for him to be spied on. Once you get it wrong, it's all over. Wait for him to hurt. Wait for him to be spied on Alina and Alice Rovin. We're partner with Vox Media Podcast Network and our intro outtrip music is created by Vane Silt. I understand that's digital. I'm giving a new thread zap that's blowing up on the Playstores actually made by Metta. What? Did you know that? What's there the same company that makes a Facebook app? What's?\\\"\": 0.1112532764673233, \"\\\" Sabotage hired goons and a landfill in Utah. How Steve Jobs' revolutionary catastrophe of a computer, the Apple Lisa, earned a brief second life and then was buried for good. Watch the Verges documentary, Lisa's final act, now on YouTube. What is going on, people of the internet welcome back to another episode of the waveform podcast. We're your host, I'm Mark Hes. I'm Andrew. Oh, Andrew's not here. Andrew's not here. He's on vacation. I'm David. And Andrew is, he'll be back next week, I'm pretty sure. He's, well, maybe. There's some flight things happening and the airports are ruining everything. He got stuck somewhere in the United States. Yeah, this isn't new. We all need airports are terrible. But we do have a lot to talk about this week. So we're going to do all of that. We have a bit of a backlog. YouTube testing some games. Pixel Fold review is out. Tesla charging standard is just, all the dominoes are falling at once and it's all happening. Yes. First of all, wait, David, you know this is a video podcast, right? Wait, is my camera being covered up? You are a completely behind. Oh, sorry. Laptop that you brought. Let me maybe, sorry, I'll just moving it. Turn it. There we go. Oh, that's huge difference that just made better, right? Jet. Oh, that's fine. Oh, it's glitching. No way. Really? I am shocked by this. Okay, can we, can we, can you explain what's in front of you? Yes. Yes, I don't know. I have not seen this until now. Okay, so this got announced at CES and finally, finally, came out like that a couple weeks ago. That is actually all you had to say. Yeah. That explains so much of what I'm looking at. If this was announced at CES, it finally just came out in June. Okay, so what is this? This computer is called the Lenovo Yoga 9i or Yoga Book 9i. It's a dual screen laptop. Laptop. Yeah. It's strong word. Laptop is a strong word because you can't really use it on your laptop. You can sometimes. There's basically four different form factors of it. I got very excited when I saw it at CES and then a friend of the show. Michael Fisher did a review on it recently and I was like, well, this is kind of sick. Who are you and can that fold? I know exactly. That is, that qualifies. It does fold in half. But it's kind of dope because as two screens, so you can either have it in like dual screen landscape orientation or dual screen portrait orientation. And it's got this like folding, what would you call it? The origami back kickstand. I see that. That also wraps around the exterior keyboard. It's actually very cool. I'll just show it to you real quick. Okay. So you can close it like this. Cool though. Yeah, I'm trying. I'm really trying. And then the origami, not only does it hold the pen, it wraps around the keyboard. Okay. It's got it like that. But then the magnets aren't very strong. Can I hold it? Yeah, you want to hold it? The magnets don't seem very strong on that or this. I thought this was magnetizing to the laptop. No, no. Oh, so you have to hold, you have to carry both. Yeah, yeah. You also have to carry the mouse. So you have to carry the laptop, the case, and the mouse all separately. Yes. Why? Yeah. I know. Is this actually good or is this just kind of a fun thing to report? It's fun. Like, if you're bored with laptops, this is cool, but this is actually not. But there's so many form factors like like that. So like, I mean, yeah, it's like origami, right? Yeah. Yeah, there you go. Magnets. So you can have it, yeah, it like leans back. For audio listeners, I'm very sorry. There's only one angle. There's only one angle. Yeah. And it's, well, no, because there's that. Well, then a top screen, I guess, those more angles. Yeah, I don't know. Anyway, I'm just messing with it. It's fun. It's a fun piece of tech. I wonder about these types of computers sometimes. Yeah. Because I see sometimes the Lenovo Yoga book and all the ones that like flip over and the commercial with like, use it in tent mode. Use it in, yeah, but in tablet mode. Yeah. And they work. And as a reviewer, I guess I can only say like, yeah, they do work. But as a user, I can't help but wonder like, how many people actually use it in these different modes? Lenovo is like the only company that would ever make something like this. Of course. Because they just make so many products that probably nobody buys. Well, off-axis, that screen is blue. Yeah, the screens are not color matched like at all. Oh, gosh. Yeah. So it's running a 15 watt i7 Intel processor, but it's the U series. So it's 15 watts. So like, you probably can't do anything that intensive on this. But personally, like for research purposes and stuff, it's kind of fun. I think ultimately I would rather just use two arc instances on my 16 inch MacBook Pro. Yeah. But I was that guy at the coffee shop yesterday with it. I would do you have a vertical like, yes, I did. So you had the keyboard in front of you. Uh-huh. A screen in front of you. And then on top of that, a second screen because of how you had it oriented oriented. Or oriented. Yeah, oriented. That's weird. Thanks. What were you using it for? Like, what were you writing the podcast? I was doing, I was had the script on the top and I had the websites I was referencing the info from on the bottom. And as someone who uses two screens all the time because I like using two screens, I would never use this as my major. That's what I was looking for. That's exactly what I was getting to. I feel like we're so generous. We're like, oh yeah, it's like kind of cool and the origami and the magnets are kind of strong and I would never use this. Yeah. It's cool and fun and I just wanted to play with it. So that's totally fair. And it's the closest any tech manufacturer has gotten to crumple phone. There's like seven creases in this thing. If not more. That's true. Actually, we're on the fast track to progress, baby. But they did think they get through really well. The origami thing wraps around the keyboard. It holds the pen. Yeah. I can agree with that. It's well thought out. Yeah. There are a lot of clever things that they did to make it do what it does. Yes. I would still not use it that correct. Got it. So I don't know. Yeah, Fisher and I have had a fun time talking about it. I close minded. Is that crazy? I just would never. Whatever. What is tent mode? Tent. Oh. Well, so there are technically five modes for this, right? Right. Tent mode is the thing that Lenovo tried to push when the original yoga came out that was the first computer to like go around 360 degrees. For the audio listeners, David has folded the laptop hinge backwards on itself. So now it's sort of this triangle with two outward facing screens. I'm a tent. Yeah. So I'm always one. I'm a TV. So at this point, you can just sort of do this if you don't want it to be like. Would you ever do that? Well, my Google Doc is on the other side. Yeah, it's shining. It's screen up. Wait, doesn't that turn off? The other screen went into tent mode? No. Which seems badly designed. I also want to play like GoFit or a guest who were battleship or I also want, well, no, because you can't have two mice doing two separate things. You just have to fling that instance back and forth. They're not going to touch screens. They are, but it would like pull focus from your mouse. If I was like working on something, it would pull focus to the other side. Oh. If it could run like two separate mice with two separate instances, and you could just have two people working on two different documents on one computer, that'd be dope. That would be a series processor. That would be insane. It would do the other side of the table. Yeah, I don't know. If you use your laptop in tent mode, please tweet at David and know I want to see the screen. Like, on a run screen, not just like I have a laptop that can sometimes go into tent mode, I want to hear from you if you actively bought a laptop because it can go into tent mode. And then you do it all the time. Yeah. I don't believe you do that. Yeah. Yeah. I also want to know it really quickly that when I took this out of the box, everything worked. And then it had 75 Windows updates, which I'm not even joking. Wow. I installed all of them and then everything broke. All of the like putting the keyboard, oh, because I didn't even show you this feature yet. So if you want to, you could use it like this. And then you take the keyboard out of the thing. And if you put it at the top of the bottom screen, this becomes a trackpad. I've seen that. And so if I'm like a listener's David just took the keyboard, put it on the second screen, and it's like where a normal keyboard would be on a laptop. Yeah. And if you put it on the bottom part of the second screen, you get this thing where either your calendar or your outlook shows up here. And then a really crappy like Microsoft news thing is on the right side. And you can't change this at all. I want to make a video on this called, this is really cool, comma, I would never use it. You want to make the video? I kind of think that's what this is. Yeah. We could. I think I'm I kind of like every UCS product dream. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. You go to see, yes, and you see things like this and you're like, oh, cool. And they just walk away. Yeah. And that's kind of what this probably was. But Lenovo is the only company that actually ships this stuff. Fair enough. But it's just so crappy that you cannot replace this crummy like news widget. It's just permanently there. You can't edit this bar at all. Man. Yeah. It was pretty much Fisher's biggest grape with the thing. Good for you, Lenovo. I mean, not good, but still you're doing things. You're keeping it interesting and I got to give you credit for that. I wish I could use Ark on this, but not on Windows yet. So I'm stuck with Edge. Yes, you are. Or Chrome. Or Chrome. Oh, yeah. Anyway, I actually reset it and it finally works again. Oh, that's good. I'm happy for you. There's another problem, but I think we shouldn't move on. Let's talk about YouTube first. I can. All right. So we had this on the dock. We wanted to talk about this. I actually have no idea how they plan on doing this because they had some steady integration a while ago that kind of sounded like this. But the new headline is that YouTube is testing games on the platform. Yeah. You got games on your platform? The idea is you'd be able to play a game on YouTube.com. That's the whole idea. Yeah, either on the website on desktop or also on iOS and Android. Netflix did this last year. They launched like a games thing. How did that go? It's out in the US. I haven't tried a lot of them. It feels kind of like crummy mobile games. Yeah, I've heard mixed things. One of my friends said that they did it one night when they didn't know what to watch. So they just played the game. And it was like mildly entertaining. And then another friend said they tried it. And it was the most janky thing ever. So they just never used it again. In my eyes, it's like the Chrome dinosaur game when your internet's out. Just a really, really low priority background thing to do. Will you have nothing better to do? It's something Netflix wants to do to keep people on the platform. So that they can serve you more ads or maybe after you finish the game, all of the shows are right there. So you're like, I might as well watch a show. They just don't want you to leave Netflix. And I guess YouTube's doing the same thing. So the the state of your thing from a while ago, from remembering it correctly, was actually kind of cool. It wasn't a cool idea. The integration. Yeah, it was an integration where like never came out. YouTube video about a game where you're let's say playing through a specific level of a game. And if you liked the gameplay, you could actually hit a button and it would jump you into that level of that game where you could play it yourself. So this sort of stadium was the cloud gaming thing and the YouTube was cloud videos and they would all talk to each other. It would be this super cool immersive thing. And I kind of liked that idea, but now stadium is dead. Yeah, it was cool because it was like, there were specific integrations. You could be watching back when YouTube gaming was a thing. Yeah. Before they closed that down. You could be watching someone playing a live stream of a game and they could be trying a level over and over and over again. And if they didn't couldn't finish the level, they could be like, any do you think any you guys could do this? And you could literally like hop into exactly where they were in the game, where their character was with the same items like everything. That was the dream. They never released that feature. But then you know, stadium died. Crazy Google never kills things. Oh, we never even talked about this. By the way, speaking of Google killing things, they killed Google domains. Google killed another thing. Google Tom. That's crazy. Yes, it's crazy about that. What is we just moved Mkbhd.com to Google domains? I have everything on Google. Like a week before they nuke it. All of my time. Great. Yeah. But yeah, so this is kind of a weird thing. Like I could see them being like, okay, well, we made stadium. We did built out a lot of features in stadium. So you might as well like use some of that technology in YouTube if we have an opportunity to whether or not they actually use any of the stadium stuff or they just go the Netflix Brow and make it like really crappy mobile games. I have no idea. I have a prediction. It's a bold prediction. Yep. This will be killed in a year. Well, if it even comes out in a year, because currently they are the only reason this article is posted about this is that they are asking people internally to only at Google to test it. So it's not public yet. Okay. And whether or not it even becomes public in the future, we have no idea. They could just be messing around. But I think it just got leaked that a bunch of internal Googlers were like, oh, my computer just turned off. Wait. Okay. I got it. I thought it was reportedly testing it. Yeah. So this is something sort of behind the scenes that they maybe are possibly working on. Yeah. So I don't know. It's just weird to have these streaming services and be like, we're a weird gaming service now, sort of, but it's not legit games. It's like really weird mobile games. Oh, weird supported games. Yeah. It's like when steam started putting mobile games on steam. And it was just like, because there's Fallout shelter, do you remember that game? It was like a Fallout game, but it was not Fallout. It was like a little just mobile, oh, the Android version. Yeah. But it was not even remotely Fallout. It was like a little like castle game. Anyway. Yeah, just weird. Just more adding weird features to weird streaming services, which is strange. I'm going to we should like place bets on when it would come out and then how long it would take to kill it. YouTube just killed stories like a month ago. Yeah. They're they're chopping things. They are chopping things. Speaking of chopping things. Oh, we also have on the dock TikTok plans on closing down what they initially made basically as a B real clone. It's called what was it called TikTok now? TikTok now. So B real for those who are, let's say over the age of 30, I think it takes right now. Yeah, B real was just a real time or is it is a real time social network where essentially once per day everyone on the app at the same time gets notification and has to take a picture. And it started kind of blowing up. This was post 2020. I don't know if it's associated with the pandemic at all, but it definitely blew up and had this moment where other social networks were like, oh, they had that moment that we don't have on the podcast. Is this a social network or a feature? Yeah, is this a platform or a feature? So for B real is their entire platform and for TikTok, they're like, I think we could make this a feature. Yes. So they made their own version of it where everyone would get a notification at the same time. Instagram has it too. Yeah. What is there is called? I don't know. It has. Yeah. No one uses it. I don't think. I think they'll kill it too. But yeah, I think what we're all discovering is B real has a specific kind of like, I don't want to say cult following, but people use B real to use B real as different as not Instagram as not TikTok. Yeah. So people on TikTok don't want to use it the way they were using B real. Yeah. So yeah, I'm not shocked that this ends up getting pulled, but also that B real is kind of crashed. Yeah. The interesting thing about that is that a parent like B real launched as a way to be the sort of anti social media curated Instagram thing because Instagram stories, which was stolen from Snapchat stories, yeah, just like Instagram became a way to kind of like only post when you're having fun, only post when you look great, you know? And so there was sort of this like anti, especially the Gen Z is like very for this, but like not just posting a curated version of yourself posting yourself in an everyday scenario to make people not feel like comparative against each other. So the whole B real thing was like, it's going to go off at a random time. You have to post it within two minutes. Otherwise, otherwise you get like docked for it. But I think that people liked it at first, but then every single day it was just like people at their desk. Another people in their bed, in their car. Yeah, it is just the same content every day. And there is still a pretty dedicated community to it, but there were reports that the user based dropped 60 something percent, 61 percent between October 22 and March 23. And I think that people are just getting like tired of seeing each other in mundane scenarios because it's like, why am I even on my phone? Yeah, that's six months. That's pretty dramatic. Yeah, it's a pretty good job. B-Roll does dispute those numbers. Of course. But, you know, who knows? And ultimately, yeah, I think it's just like a platform and this feels just like Clubhouse, right? Yeah. Clubhouse, Clubhouse had its rise in popularity like very associated with the pandemic and it was very much like, hey, we're all at home now. But what if I just jumped in a room that's an audio only room? So I don't have to like do my hair and makeup. So I just like show up and people are talking and we have this room of people. And it had this really big social moment. And then every other social network almost feels like every other social network went way to second. We could build that as a feature. As a feature. Yeah. And one by one, they all built it as a feature. And then Clubhouse would still exist, but doesn't really. It's just kind of a crypto thing now. Sort of like a wasteland, like a tumbleweed will pass by and then you'll hear like crypto noises passing back. And you'll be like, ah, it's Clubhouse. Yeah. The feature exists in some other social networks, but a lot of them have killed that. And it's beyond social networks, right? It's in Slack now. Like Slack has rooms now. That actually kind of makes sense. Yeah. It makes like, it's called huddles and rooms. Yeah. I believe. Yeah. Beyond just social networks, just all of these applications were like, wouldn't make sense just to have an audio room. And it was a reaction to the pandemic because people were saying they missed the like random coffee or like a water. Just water cooler conversation. Cooler conversation. Yeah. So it became a space where you could just drop in and sort of just like talk to people. And it was really populated in the pandemic as people are isolated. I also have this really depressing story about Clubhouse that I wanted to say really quickly. So right when it was getting popular, I didn't really know what it was. So I downloaded it. I was like in my apartment with Michael, we were just sitting in the living room. I go into it and there's a room called Quiet Room and there were like thousands of people in it. I was like, oh, so I dropped into the room and everyone was on mute. And I was like, man, this is so cool. At least right. It's like weird. It's like a weird human experience thing where everyone's alone and everyone's lonely but because you're in this silent room, this quiet room, you know that there's all these other people that are having the exact same experiences you and that's like heartwarming in a way. And then I found out I was completely wrong and it was just a follow for follow thing. It was like you go in the room and follow every single user and then every other user follows you. You had this like wholesome like, yes, you in the moment. Yeah. Oh no, this is just F for F. Because I looked at F and I was like, this is so cool. And I looked at like quiet rooms on Clubhouse and there are all these articles. They're like follow for follow quiet rooms and I said, oh my God. I like how follow for follow is like a forever thing in the internet. Yeah, I don't always see a thing. It's always been a thing. Yeah. Wow. So yeah, I don't know why TikTok is closing it down. Like I don't know. I just like never caught on the same reason YouTube's killing stories. It still seems weird to close down features that already exist that you don't really have to like maintain that much. I think it's just like code bloat. Yeah, it's just like bloat on this platform that they don't they want to focus on their core thing. They might as well just remove the distraction. I can see YouTube closing stories because I got a random YouTube story in my feed last week. But only one channel that I'm subscribed to ever post stories. And so it's just weird having like one in a bunch of white space. And I think that's why YouTube closed that down for sure. Yeah. The TikTok thing I have, I don't even have TikTok. So I don't even know what it looked like before. Yeah. I never even saw this feature. Well, literally never even saw it. There you go. Probably like a little isn't it down. Well, we should we got a bunch more to talk about. We should take a break. But of course, that means we should do our first trivia question. Yeah. Trivia. Okay. Trivia, dude. So first question. Twitch is obviously wildly popular for gaming streamers, which YouTube responded to by launching YouTube gaming. It was launched in 2015. One was it discontinued and just made part of the YouTube app. Oh man. Yeah, they had a separate app. There was a separate YouTube gaming app. Yeah. Briefly. For less than a year, I think. I don't know how long. I don't know. You'll get one point for the year, two points if you get the month as well. Well, yeah. That'll be a shot in the dark, but I'm going to try. I bet Andrew gets it when I ask him later. I know. He might know. You might know. I mean, I could tell you that it died. I couldn't tell you when, but I'm going to try. I remember reading the news article about it coming out and downloading it immediately when I read the article. I never used it again. I remember seeing that it was a separate app and I went, ah, not going to use that. Dumbed. Yeah. I was working really boring data and tree jobs. So it was the most exciting part of my day. That's why I like that. That was an Intel. That was a worst company. If that could possibly be one. Anyway, well, we're going to do the answers at the end. So we'll be right back. Fox creative. This is advertiser content brought to you by WhatsApp. Privacy is empowerment and agency. Billions of texts are sent every day. And you may think they're private, but without end to end encryption, cybersecurity expert Matt Mitchell says our messages are anything but secure. Many times there's an assumption that we're having a private conversation with just our friends when we're actually having that conversation in a very crowded elevator filled with random people, some who might not have our best interest at heart. With WhatsApp, your personal messages are kept private by default to understand how we asked Matt to share an ABCs of end to end encryption. A is for asymmetric. With asymmetric encryption, it uses mathematics and we are forging a public key and a private key when we use a product like WhatsApp. This lock-in key exists inside the device itself. When you send a message, it is scrambled the entire time, only visible to you and to the intended recipients. B is for backdoor. A backdoor is a secret way to get in to the message. They can be created by bad actors or hacked in. And C is for cipher. We're talking about the way is that the messages are scrambled and the ways they can be decoded. Almost like a secret decoder ring. So when you send your personal messages through WhatsApp's end to end encrypted platform, you know no third parties can decipher them. The more we use good digital hygiene, the more we protect all of us WhatsApp. Always message privately. This year, Pride Month was dominated by one song, Padampadam by Kylie Minogue. I'm switched on pop producer Rihanna Cruz and this week we're doing a deep dive into Padampadam and it's growing status as a gay anthem leading us to the question. What makes a gay anthem? Is it the diva at its center or is it something more? This episode of switched on pop, I talk to multiple experts and friends to understand how songs like these tend to connect with our community. You can find switched on pop anywhere you get your podcasts. All right, we're back. Last week was a shockingly busy week for devices. Not just last week, but like this time of year is usually quiet. Weirdly, it's really busy. We had to review all the new Apple stuff. And then last week we had two new pixel products, the pixel fold and the tablet. And just yesterday, hopefully maybe, we published these end-phone 10 review. Yeah, we definitely didn't. We never mind. But should I redo? Well, I have thoughts on it. Well, that review may be later, but hey, the pod people get a little bonus because it'll be earlier on the pod. That's true. Yeah, that's true. So what do you want to do first? Yeah, so what do you want to do first? I mean, I guess the pixel tablet we can do first. Okay. Simple one. The pixel tablet, the review is out. It's about what we thought. No real dramatic surprises here. It's an Android tablet. It's a $599, $499 tablet that comes with the dock in the box. And the dock is like this magnetic speaker dock, which has pins and you just pop it on there. And it becomes like a home hub. You pop it off and it's a tablet. Cool. My main discovery when actually using it for a while was the speaker dock is not that good. Great. Yeah. It's fine. Like the speakers themselves on the tablet are completely lacking any base. Yeah. They're very tinny. So when you pop it onto the tablet dock, it actually sounds much better because you get like all this base goods a much larger driver. But it doesn't actually get that much louder. And so when I compare it to like the $229, obviously it's pricey for a home speaker, but it's cheaper than the tablet. When I compare it to that, a Nest Hub Mac speaker, the Nest Hub Macs is much louder and has better mics from far away and can be a security camera which the tablet can't and is on 24.7. But you can't pop it off and use it as a tablet. So it kind of exists at the top of the home hub lineup, but at the bottom of the tablet lineup, I'm curious if you have thoughts on it, but I thought it was all right. I think the Nest Hub Macs has better audio though, right? Yeah, 100%. Yeah. Like a lot better speakers. Yeah. Definitely. So you're really paying like almost actually more than double to have the tablet. For the ability to pop it off and use it as a tablet anywhere. That's sort of the weird sort of thing with this product is that if you remove the separate, like that you can buy another speaker dock separately for $130, if you removed this the whole speaker dock thing from it and you're like, oh, this is a $270 pretty good pixel tablet. You'd be like, so this is a really good price for an Android tablet. It's running a tensor chip. It's like pretty good like very good price for a tablet. But in my head, and I think this is how Google is marketing this thing, it is a, well, I guess their marketing is the pixel tablet, but I see it as a home hub that you normally use as a home hub. That every now and then you're like, I want to watch Netflix on the couch, every now and then you're like, I need to move the ingredients for this recipe over to the other side of the kitchen. So you move it over there. And I don't think Google really wants you to take it on the road that often. They just sort of like added a USB-C port so that if you did, they technically could. Do you think they should have done it the other way around? Like right now, the only way you can buy this tablet is as a $500 bundle with the dock. Do you think they should have sold it as a $300 tablet without the dock? I think that I would find that easier to recommend. I think the dock being $130 is ridiculously expensive, especially considering the speakers aren't good. If the speakers were, okay, and here is another thing too. There's a story that went out that said, Google removed the Wi-Fi chip in the dock. They originally were going to put its own chip in the dock so that it could be a separate smart speaker, which makes a lot of sense. If you- Because you can buy these separately, right? So if you could have these just like, they're basically home speakers just sitting around your house. And even if you didn't have a pixel tablet on it, you could be playing music from it. You could be using them as assistants. 130 bucks for a smart audio speaker is about what a smart audio speaker of that quality costs. Like a Nest Audio is like what? Like $100? Not even. Yeah, I think they're like $100. They have good audio. So if you could basically buy a Nest Audio that you could also pop a tablet onto to charge and use as an interface- I think I'm going to fill a little one. Then this one. Then Nest Audio. That one, yeah. How much is $100? $100. Yeah. For $130. Like that's okay. But the fact that it's $130 for a thing that is a brick. It's a brick when there's no tablet. When there's no tablet on it. Yep. It's like- It's tough. Why would you buy extra of these? Like you're just going to have things plugged in that do literally nothing unless you figure that oh, maybe I'll move the tablet over. Here's a- Here's some other context. For the same money, you could buy a Nest Hub for one room and a Nest Hub Max for another room. And still have money left over. Yeah. Because the Nest Hub is $100 and the Nest Hub Max is $230. That's $330. That's better audio on the matter of fact toss in another Nest Hub. That's $330. You're still under. Wow. $430. So you have a Nest Hub in the bedroom, a Nest Hub in the living room, and a Nest Hub Max in the kitchen. Or you could put a Nest Audio somewhere. Yeah, exactly. And you're still spent less than this tablet with the one dock. That's crazy. So it's like- It feels like because it's a tablet it's a really good price. Yeah. But it is- It is very interestingly placed. Yeah, I have a question about that. Yeah. So you know how sometimes people will release a product and they can charge whatever they want because it's the only thing of that product? Is this one of those moments where because there's nothing that's a one-to-one, it's the same- I don't think it's charged whatever they wanted. I don't think that people want Android tablets badly enough that they can charge whatever they want for this. But the only thing that could convince me, yes, is there was that moment on stage at Google I-O where they sort of teased it at first and they showed the tablet and they showed it, clicking on to the dock and everyone went, oh, yeah. That's cool. Including Andrew. Yeah. And it is the only one that does exactly that. And so if you do picture yourself using that particular feature a lot, then there is no comparison. Yeah. This is the only one you can get. So then follow up question, how long does that remain true? How long before Lenovo makes one? How long before Arnie has been making this kind of thing? It's not exactly the same. I'm off of a speaker. Yes. Interesting. They made one years ago in 2018. Google is like, okay, you use the Google Home app, and you use all Google services, so you get the Google one. Yeah, that makes the most sense. Yeah. As of right now, the way my tablet lives in my house is it's on a folio case. It's in a folio case all the time and it's just like... Plugged in, apparently. It's not even plugged in. It just wanders around the kitchen and eventually it's plugged in when it's about to die. Yeah. Yeah. Almost the same thing. My speakers are loud enough that it's actually the same thing. Yeah. So it's just weird because they marketed it as pixel tablet, but that's not in my head what this product is. It's a Nest Hub large, always worse audio. Yeah, with worse audio. That can also be called a tablet. Yeah, it's a hub. They should have called it Nest Hub tablet. Nest Hub Ultra Go. Or Nest Hub Tab. Nest Hub Tab Go Ultra. Tablet. If you had better specs, you could call it Ultra. I don't know. Yeah, it's just because it's the biggest screen. Yeah, it's a... Yeah, but it's 60 Hertz. It's the display's fine. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, it's definitively fine. Bad off-axis viewing angles, but whatever. There was a little bit of questions for me and this can kind of bring us into the pixel fold of the tablet app experience. Yeah. Because this has been a thing we've talked about every single time there's a pixel. Any Android tablet at all is, oh, well, are the apps going to be better? Yeah. And there was always a small handful of apps where you're really impressed and then the rest of the apps, you're like, oh, no, it's not better at all. And things like Instagram and Twitter aren't exactly grown on the iPad either, but you can keep going down the list. And YouTube Studio is not optimized on the tablet. A lot of my mobile apps that are on the inside screen with the pixel fold, like my golf app is not optimized. It's just a lot of apps still aren't great on the tablet. So that's still a thing. The new weather app is awesome. Yeah. Google made a weather app. They did make a brand new weather. Yeah. I'll give them that. But I think that's specifically for you. I always talk about weather apps in my area. Listening. Yeah, we can talk about the pixel fold because this has been in my pocket for, what, almost two weeks now. Yeah. And the review of it is also out. And it's a weird phone that I kind of actually like a lot, but I realize I won't be recommending them most people. Also fun fact. I played a beach tournament over this past weekend. And this phone was in my bag at the beach for three straight days. And it somehow hasn't died. I actually didn't put it in the Ziploc or anything. I know there's got to be some sand in here. It's like a ticking time bomb. Ron Amadeo over at ours Technica. Yeah, he literally only used this on his desk. He hadn't even moved it from his desk while he was writing about it. He should have taken it to the beach. I literally want to a beach for three days. He might have just gotten super unlucky. He gets unlucky very frequently with a lot of devices. I like it does. Yeah. So the thing about this phone is that it folds completely flat. And can I see it really quickly? Yeah. When you open it, there's not really much space between the bezel and the screen. It's just kind of there. Wait, I thought the thing is that it doesn't fold completely flat. It does fold completely flat. It doesn't open completely flat. It doesn't quite open. It opens to like 177 degrees. So closed, it is a flat sandwich with no air gap. Oh, I see. I see. Yes. It's nice. And I do really like that. I think the problem is they have this like screen protector that doesn't see the edges. It doesn't completely go to the bottom. Which very much feels like a Galaxy Fold Gen 1. I might do it with anyone. Yeah. Because they had to add these before they sent out production units while they were like they had them in reverse hands. They didn't have these like caps in the top and bottom that kept dirt and debris from getting in. And the fold, it's just raw OLED underneath the screen protector. And raw OLED is very dangerous. And so I guess Ron had like a piece of dirt or dust that got onto the little bezel part that is raw OLED. And because he when he closed it because there's like almost no space between the bezel and the actual screen. You just clap and sand and directly into raw OLED on his desk too, right? Like, so. So just have a desk to just cover it in sand. Yeah. And it's like I only use it on my desk. I don't know. There's a lot of sand here. I would say if you do buy this thing, you should definitely get the like pixel protection for it. Yeah. Because yeah. Here's what I'll say. Clearly Google was very protective. It seems like they sent out a lot less of these phones for you. Like there are being very cautious with it. I felt like I was reasonably normal with mine. Like I have some nicks on the top. I have some nicks on the bottom. I took it to a beach. Yeah, the camera area looks kind of scarred up a little. Yeah, it's a little scarred up. Yeah, I really used it. Yeah. And my conclusion at the end of the day was this is the best folding phone to use while closed. Yeah. I use this phone closed all the time like normal. And I really only open it once in a while when I go, you know what? I've got 15 new emails. Yeah. I've got some time to burn. Let's get into it. Uh-huh. And then I would open the phone and I feel like a productivity monster. And I would do that for a while and I close it and use like a normal phone again. Yeah. It's the best at that. Yeah. That's like really what this phone is most awesome at. My least favorite thing about this phone is you cannot have a different layout on your home screen on the inside and the outside. Yeah. Yeah. So just for our listeners who are a little confused about what I mean, every other folding phone, I think every other folding phone. Yeah. The outside home screen is one setup, is one phone. And then the inside when you open it up to your inside screen, you can set up a completely different phone. You can have a different wallpaper. You can have a different set of apps and widgets. So on your outside screen, maybe it's a little cramped. You might have your texting app. Maybe your Google Maps, a couple things you access really quickly just on one home screen. But then you open up on the inside. Whoa. But then you open up on the inside. It's hard to open, guys. It's hard to open. And you end up with a whole bunch more space. So you do like two or three widgets and your games and your apps that you use all the time. Yeah. On this one, whatever you do on the inside screen, will immediately be reflected on the outside. Yeah. If you have three home screens on the outside screen, when you open it up, you'll have the exact same three on the inside screen. And you can't have them different. I will say that I like that if you're using an app on the outside screen, and you open the phone, it's immediately in that app. I like that. But I think that Google did some tweaks to Android for large screen devices and folding devices to make it so that when you have it open, it kind of sees it as two displays. Right? Because when you have it open on the inside screen, it kind of artificially sets a home screen. Yeah. If you had the home screen on your folded on the phone folded and you swiped to your second display, that second display is the right side of the inner screen. Yeah. So screen one on the left, screen two on the right. And the only thing that spans is the Google search bar. Yep. Actually, weirdly, that's the only thing like you can't, like you can't place widgets in the center. Yeah. Yeah. I hate it. And I think they did that. This was the biggest problem with the Microsoft Surface Duo, by the way, is that the Microsoft Surface Duo didn't see itself like that. So when you had it open, it thought it was just one big display. Yeah. So when you would span apps, it wouldn't split them. It would just have missing text in the center. You could have missing pixels. Yeah. So I think they intentionally did it. So they were like, okay, this is screen one. This is virtual screen two. And when you have it open, let's just blend them. But again, like you said, the problem with that is that you can't have different setups and like different orientations of screens. You would have a different type of setup. Yeah. So it was a little weird that that would, like it's an Android phone. I feel like if there was a folding iPhone, of course, they would do that. Yeah. I figured the Google one would let me change. Yeah. There should be at least be a setting for it. And that's something they could probably update. Yeah, they could probably update that. Yeah. It is, I will say the form factor of using it closed is amazing. Yep. It's more find and to ask, which please, Oppo, please, for the love of God, make a global version of that phone because the bands in the West don't sound better than the Oppo. You like it better? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I might need to try a smooth tensor, it's smoother on this phone than any other sensitivity. Crazy. I did think that was weird. That is weird. It's the smoothest 120 hertz Google Pixel phone ever. Do you like it better than the fold? Then the Galaxy Fold? I, yes. Yeah, I hate the form factor of the Galaxy Fold. And that's because the fold is kind of narrow. Awkward to use while closed to narrow. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I mean, the hardware is really good. Well, yeah. Yeah. It's $1,800. Yeah. So is Samsung's. That's true. But Samsung has a better inside screen, has thinner bezels, which does mean you need a weird hole punch. Or under display. Under display. Well, but they had thin bezels before they added the under display, selfie camera. Also true. So it had been a hole punch. But Samsung has better inside display, Samsung has bigger battery and better battery life and faster charging. And the cameras are about on par. Does it have a better software experience? Would you say no? Pixel is better. Pixel's got the software for sure. So, yeah, that's kind of tid for tat there. Yeah. Yeah. 30 watt charging, right? 30 watt max. But it has wireless charging. Pretty poor battery life. Yeah, that's a bummer. I've read all the reviews that didn't mention their battery life was as bad as mine. But I've continued to use this phone and continued to have subpar battery life. Yeah. I read Alison's review on the verge and she said that the benefit of using it closed all the time, which she also said, you feel like you can use it closed all the time, is that you'll get a little bit better battery life. But I didn't really, she didn't really seem to go into detail about the overall battery life. So that logic tracks perfectly. From my experience, I am using mostly the outside screen. Yeah. And my battery life is subpar. Therefore, if I use the inside screen more, I would have even worse battery life. That's my angle. Yeah, that's so fortunate. Tough. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, for you fold the pixel fold people out there. You should be the first wave of people should be they were receiving them today, which is Wednesday. Yeah. So let us now tweet at us about your experience. We'd love to know more people's experience about this thing. I like the phone. Second gen one, hopefully, will be amazing. Android 14 update coming soon as well. Yes. Let's talk about this info in 10 real quick before another break. I do have some thoughts. I mean, we, so this is info nine last year. Amazing. I love this phone. Epic. This phone, I gave it some awards. I'm pretty sure I gave it that small phone. And maybe the most improved. Made it serve and else. Yeah, probably most. I really liked it. A awesome software experience. Super smooth. 120 hertz. They put the latest Snapdragon chip. It had amazing battery life. And very impressive cameras. Like across the board. It was small. It had a fast fingerprint reader. And it was 699. It was a really well priced phone. And it was the most recent. It was the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus. Right. Which means it had the best TSC. So really good battery life. And after that phone came out, I was like, yeah, they basically made the perfect phone. It doesn't have wireless charging, but like, I don't know. The only thing really bad about it is that back coating got so really gross. So fast. So then when I got the email about a Zen phone 10 coming out this year, I was like, oh, right, I forgot about that. What are they going to do with this phone this year? And it showed up. And I like put it on a wireless charger jokingly. Like, I bet they didn't add wireless charging. And it lit up and it started charging. And I was like, whoa, wait a second. I remember this moment. They did. I saw this happen. Oh my god. Yeah. And they did also change the coating on the back of the phone. Now, I haven't been able to daily it as much yet. Because I've been doing the Pixel Fold review. So I'm about to switch to it. And we'll see how much it starts to wear. But I suspect they changed it to make it better and hopefully not wear as fast. Which if that's true, they did everything. Yeah, they basically made the, and it's so, it's like, is this one also 699? It is, I got a double check, but I don't think, yeah, it's the same price as yours. That is insane. I don't know how they pulled this off. I love it. It's basically like the iPhone Mini for Android users. It's got like the Max specs. It's got, but it's got better battery life than the iPhone Mini by far. Dramatically better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like so good. Yeah, I don't know. If you only buy your phones at carrier stores, you can't get this. I don't think so like buy it online, but I think be an H sells us phone. But ASUS is pretty underrated. I think their camera experience is really good because they don't lean super hard into computational photography. So they have more contrast than a lot of manufacturers because they don't go super hard on the HDR. Yeah, I think that's a good look. And they generally score very high in the blind smartphone camera test. This is true. Whenever we do the blind tests, it kind of has a a pixily look in a way. And I think people don't really expect that. And it's actually kind of confirmed to be an ASUS thing because the ROG gaming phones also have a camera. What you're like, it's a gaming phone. Who would ever think it's good, but ASUS is good. Really good hardware or software. I will say one more thing. What was I going to say? They count with new colors. There is there's a nice there's a nice green. There's a nice blue. There's the orange from last year. There's a white and there's a black. And the red is like brighter. You have the orange. It's more red. I guess you're right. Yeah, it's more red. Yeah, it's brighter. Yeah. What was I going to say? What was I going to say? Well, Marquez is struggling. Last year when the Zenfone 9 came to our office, we're all seasoned vets here. We see a lot of phones. So it takes a lot to impress us. But I remember when the Zenfone 9 showed up, it was one of those things where Marquez took out of the box and the whole studio was swarmed him. What's that? Oh, that looks new. That's different. Oh, I like the way this feels. I've always loved the Zenfones because they made the first phone. I think the Zenfone 7 or maybe the sitting, it was the 6, I think. It had the flippy camera. Yeah. It had this camera that it was facing the back. But then if you pressed the button, it would flip around. It was really cool. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I never remembered what I was going to say. So that's hopefully it'll hit me again later. Do you remember that at lunch? Yeah. But Zenfone 10, I am very happy that the things that they should do. 699 is legit insane pricing. It's so... Oh, that's what I was going to say. The... Let's go. So... If Asus, if I was to make my own phone, Asus did something that I think I would also do, which is in the setup process when you first get the phone, you go through like signing to your email, sign up, WiFi or whatever. Yeah. And then you literally have a menu where it's like, do you want pure stock Android or do you want our like Asus Optimized? Zen UI. Yeah. And you get to... I don't even if they... I don't think they even call that anymore. It's just like Asus optimized. Oh. And it has a couple new fonts, a couple new icons, a couple extra features. And you can just choose. You go through like four or five panels where it's like home screen setup. What do you want? Stock or Asus? Yeah. All right. Launcher. What do you want? Stock or Asus? That's cool. And the whole thing. And quick settings. What do you want? And so you go through and you set up the phone. And so right off the box, you're already like, customizing it like a true Android. That's awesome. Should be. It's great. They did that because I think when the ROG phone three came out, I remember people were not super happy with the gaming, the insanely hardcore gaming UI that the ROG phone had in the one and the two. So when the three came out, I remember they made it a big deal. They were like, we're letting you like use stock Android on this if you want. So you get the gaming prowess and all the features of the gaming phone, but you don't have to use the ROG vaults with all the hardcore. Hard game mode. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. And then they ported that to the Zenphone on like the Zenphone six or something. And everyone was like, this is the best thing ever. Yeah. They're still do though. And it's like broken down into like sections of the phone. That's awesome. Yeah. Didn't used to be that way. So that's cool. Shout out to Asus. Shout out to Asus. All of the tests is on phone 10. I hope there's no surprises where it's like, oh, it turns out the battery life is trash now. Like I hope there's nothing like that. But I have a pretty hard time believing I'm going to find anything like that. Yeah. It was great battery life last year, especially for a tiny phone. So that's that. Cool. Plus like another quick break, but we should of course do one more trivia question. This is new light colors from last year. No, this is the same as last week. Okay. I think trivia. Maybe a pink trivia. Yeah. I think trivia. I like it sparkly. It's fun. Magenta. Yeah. Anyway, fun fact guys. WWDC wasn't always called WWDC. Really? The first one in 1983 was called A. Macintosh developers world gathering the MDWG. B. The Apple Independent Software Developers Conference or AIS DC. C. The Santa Clara Developers Symposium. SCDS. Or D. The Global Electronic Information Coders Open House. Or the GE ICO. Guy co. Guy co. Guy co. I wanted to know. I can't be. But I wanted to be. It's so funny. Could it? Oh man. It could be. I don't know. L.S. questions are often tricky. L.S. questions are the one that leave you staring at your bedroom ceiling at night. Yeah. Yeah. This is interesting one because I don't know the answer. Yeah. I was going to say Macworld. Cool. Well with that, we shall take a break. Bear it back. All right. Welcome back. Let's talk about EVs. Welcome to the Wave Form. Or non-podcast. Wave EV form. The EV section. Yes. There's really only one piece of news that matters in the EV world in the past couple weeks because it's been happening over and over and over again. Every day. As dominoes continue to fall and hit each other and knock over other dominoes and more dominoes, we'll continue to fall in the future probably between by the time we record this and this comes out. There will be another domino. Definitely. But the news is there are two basically competing charging standards in North America for electric cars. There is Tesla's port which you've all seen on Tesla's. It's called NACS, North American charging standard. And then there's the other one, CCS. I mean, there's some others that you've probably seen in some other cars. But CCS is the other big one for fast charging. And that's the one that you see for public charging. And every other EV that's not a Tesla. And we've talked at length about this and how there are a big difference between the quality and availability and uptime and reliability and ease of use of the Tesla Supercharger network and every other public charger network. So the news is all these EV manufacturers are slowly actually pulling a trigger on signing a deal to have their cars use Tesla's Supercharger network. Yeah. And that includes them starting to ship cars with Tesla's NACS port in 2025. Amazing. And giving them access to thousands and thousands of Superchargers. Not just the like seven that we have with the magic dock. Yeah. But actual like native, hopefully maximum fast charging. Yeah. And that is a big deal. So that started, I guess maybe it was last week. With Ford signing a deal. Yeah. I did this whole event on, I guess it was a Twitter space. Twitter space. I think it was two weeks ago. Probably something like that. Yeah. I think shortly thereafter GM announces that they're also going to do it. So when Ford does it, you're like, wow, F150 Lightning and Mustang Machi just got better. Then GM does it and you're like, oh wow. So now the Hummer EV is in there too. The Cadillac, Lyric, whatever. Still not. Still not as many cars as. Not a ton, but like, hey, that's two big companies that are actually going to do this. That's cool. And then more Domino's fall and more Domino's fall. So now what do we have? We got Rivian. We got Rivian saying them move over. So R1T and R1S. Yeah. And then R2. R2 when that platform launches. R2. That's going straight to NECS. Yeah, yeah. Straight to Tesla's port. So that's cool. You got Volvo. Volvo's moving over. And which Volvo owns Polestar. So that means Polestar is going to be moving over. Probably. And they haven't said it yet, but I'm sure they will. Logically it checks out. Yeah. We weren't on the street as Hyundai is thinking about it. Yeah, they've been evaluating. Which I wouldn't be shocked if that Domino fell on that also meant Ionic 5, Ionic 6, all of the EV 6s, all those, those all fall. And those all get better in 2025. Like that is a lot of shake up in the world of North American EV plug charging standards. Yeah. It's great. There's a couple funny things about this. One, it's just funny that of course, Tesla called it North American charging standard when it was literally just their port. And CCS stands for Combined Charging System. So it's funny that it's becoming the standard. Another funny thing, they just start rolling out the magic docks, which allows NACS to like pour over to CCS. And that's going to be potentially irrelevant if every single car I start using Tesla. It's good for everyone who's already bought an electric car with CCS. Yeah, totally. You know, the Rivian I have now, all the other cars that are out now, those will be fine to use on a couple of chargers. Yeah, the other funny thing is that Tesla's in Europe have to legally use CCS. They always use CCS. This is why I always practice this by saying this is a very North American thing we're talking about. Yeah. Because in Europe it's like, oh, we've all already had this we've all had CCS for a long time. Yeah. So there was a video by who's like I that makes like two hour videos on Blender technology connections. Technology connections. Yeah. That's my favorite channel. Yeah, he made a video because he his friend bought an Ionic 5 and he was like, this is an opportunity for me to make like three video three two hour videos about electric cars. Okay. So he made a video about NACS versus CCS kind of and like all the technology behind it. And you just see like the size of the cabling and like the ports and everything and it's just hilarious how much smaller and like more efficient Tesla is able to be. It really is. So that port is just way better. So I feel like if people like people moving over to it is both going to be like we did a road trip right. And I had a terrible experience in the Misting Mocky because of the ecosystem of chargers. And now it's like if you can you can basically buy any electric car. You want the biggest problem that the biggest reason that it felt bad to recommend anything but a Tesla was if you drive more than 250 miles on any given day, you're going to have a bad time. Any road trip. Yeah. And I made that video on the autofocus channel about how electric cars are really hard to recommend not because the cars aren't good. The cars have gotten really good to the point where like many could argue Tesla doesn't make the best electric cars. But they are by far the best selling because the infrastructure the availability of these easy to use chargers is so dramatically better. And so yeah this news is a win for everyone I believe. Yeah. It's a win obviously for Tesla because not only are they going to get a bunch of licensing money but I believe they get a bunch of government money because now they're eligible because hey we make chargers for everyone. So that's huge for Tesla. It's huge for all of us because if we are going to buy an EV we want better charging infrastructure and we all just got it. And all the car companies who make EVs who to themselves are saying we make a better car than Tesla. Yeah. But the only reason they don't buy ours is because Tesla is a charging network. Yeah. Well guess what? Now we have a lot of the charging network available to us. So maybe they'll buy more of our good cars. Yeah. So it's great too. I mean we'll probably see some sort of a down the line effect of like how many overcrowded chargers are there going to be? How many people are going to sign up and not be able to actually charge on them? Who knows? But I just feel like it's a win at the start. Yeah. So some good news too is that charge point ever charge an SK signet there may be even more. But there are these third party chargers like Brandon and I when we were doing the CV road trip with the monkey we probably stopped at seven different brands of third party car chargers on the road. Which is crazy. The amount of third parties that there are that do electric car charging is crazy. Yeah. None of them care about uptime it seems like. Maybe they will now. But a bunch of them are starting to also say either we're fully switching over to NACS now or we're also going to offer NACS. That's cool. Which is really cool. So you're going to have third parties too. Which is good because if you have a million cars but only a 100 gas stations that's a big problem. You know, it's like Tesla's supercharger network is the biggest in the nation by far. But you already have problems with there being too many Teslas and not enough stalls. And now there's about to be F-150 lightnings and whatever else is felt there. All the different different sizes and types of vehicles. Yeah. Which was already a question mark with the magic doc. But yeah, that that remains a thing to be solved. Yeah. Future question that will will cross that bridge we get to for sure. And Washington and Texas are now. If you if they give you funding for EV infrastructure you have to offer NACS now. They just made that a law. Nice. So so that's like it's like the USB-C iPhone rule. Yeah. It kind of feels like you didn't have to mandate the port. But all right, I guess that's where we're going. Yeah. Yeah. It's yeah. You know what this all reminds me of? There's been more and more cybertruck sightings. I think it's actually coming out this year. Is that an insane take? I think it's actually coming out. You want a bet? I think it's I think it should make it better. You want a bet? Right now in the podcast. It is not coming out this year. Okay, this is a great bet because we're like halfway through the year. We got six months. Yeah. I've just noticed like them. Obviously they're they've been working on it, testing it, whatever. But suddenly there's like dozens of them. There's like mules, there's camouflage ones, they're testing like finished ones. And well not finished, but dramatically different from what they showed us. Because I remember when I was at the impressions event, however many years ago that was like 2019. Yeah, it was it was at least two, three years ago. And well, how's four years ago? I wrote in one. It was very different. The front was just like a marble shelf that looked ridiculous. It was a three-seater in the front and the back. It was a very different looking interior. And the ones that are rolling around now have a real side view mirror, have a real windshield liper, have different looking lights. I believe removed some of the features, like the the the deck lid that goes all the way to the bottom when you open the trunk. So I don't know all of the details. But it's just a very different looking truck that clearly they've done work on. And now they're sort of testing it. And just with enough frequency, I feel like it's ramping up at the same rate where, I don't know, I feel like they could probably ship them in like six months. I would bet against that. All right, so your answer is no. So the bet is just so we can codify it. Yeah. Well, the first Cybertruck deliveries to real customers happen before or after December 31st. 2023. I also want to clarify what are we qualifying as deliveries? Is it like one or three or like a thousand? Remember what they did with with a plaid? Yes. Where they had a delivery event and the first 25 cars. That's exactly what I what I mean. Like if it does that count, if they do that, if those people are not Tesla employees, that counts. So if they release 25 of these, it counts. Yes. Because they're going to keep shipping them more than next year, I think that counts. But especially if they have like a delivery event in November, and then they start shipping them in December, and there's like like real Cybertrucks on the road. That to me would count. That would count. Yeah. I how much did they say this was originally going to start at 40? We have. Well, back in the day, when they brought me their promises, I think it was like anywhere from 35, 40 to like 75, 85, something crazy. There's a huge because there's a single motor, dual motor, triple motor versions. There was different battery sizes. There's all kinds of things that they promised. They said it starts at 39,900. So 40, 39. My additional prediction is that will not happen. Oh, no, yeah. They're going to start with the most expensive triple motor variant. For sure. No, but I don't think it will ever sell for 40. Yeah, that's also probably a good bet. Yeah. I think they're going to pull a Rivian and jack up the price by 20 grand. I mean, that's happened with the Model 3, right? They promised that they're going to make several different versions, and they start with the most expensive, highest margin version and work their way down. Whether they get to the bottom or not. Who knows? But the price of the Model 3 has fluctuated in real time, depending on the week. But I feel like the Cybertruck will never, they will just be like, we had to jack the price by 20 grand. Like Rivian did. That's exactly what Rivian did. 20 grand? The fifth, so the cheapest one would be. I think the cheapest one of this is going to be 55 or 60. Yeah, I could say 50. I agree. They said they could make it cheaper because it's like a solid piece of metal that they don't want to sculpt in whatever. And that's why it's all jagged. But I don't think that it don't think it's going to make it cheaper. They added like seven years of development with this thing that they have to make up the R&D cost for a lot. They also do have an absurd number of pre-orders, though. I don't know how many people are actually going to follow through with them. It was like, like, a hundred bucks to get in line or something like that. So it still is. You can order right now. I just put a lot of people in line. Okay, so if 25 of these come out this year, that counts. Should we set a number is 25 of the fairs? I think 25 is a fair number. 25 is a fair number. Okay, I'm still saying no. You're saying yes. I'm saying they will. David. I'm saying no. That was absolutely not. Yeah, Stan's alone. Look at me and Optimus. Did you see that? Have you seen that Tom Scott video where he goes to the building in Texas? And it's like a scam. The building. The empty. Like the blue prince he submitted. They were like inches instead of feet. So what was supposed to be like a 90-story building is a three-story building. What? That's the gist of it. It's like this weird looking skyscraper. The guy submitted plans to a developer and just instead of did the one tick instead of two ticks for inches instead of feet. And then built this tiny building for way over price and dip town with the rest of the money. That's what the cyber track is going to be. Elon's going to hand out a bunch of matchbox hot wheels, size cars. Wait, why don't we think we are seeing a lot of them now? Yeah, we see. Yeah, there's no more truth in and out. Yeah, in the world of auto blogs and spy shots. There's a really high level of... There's a bunch of spy shots of the new Porsche 911, which people suggest that they're going to make a hybrid 911 as their next flagship sports car. And there's been a handful of them spotted at the N\\\\u00fcrburgring. And all the articles I'm reading are like, this is going to launch in 2023. I'm like, what? There's... Okay, that seems like a really fast turnaround. Which is like they're testing a like a spy-kitted camouflage version of it now. And by the time they ship it in three, four months, they'll be finished testing. It'll be good to go. And that seems to have a super high degree of confidence. Why isn't cyber trucking that? Because it's Tesla. I don't think they're going to... I agree. They're going to build up the hype even more. I don't think even if it's ready, they're not going to release it. You think this is more of a marketing? Yes. And I think I don't think it'll be ready to go maybe early next year if that's the case. But I don't think they're going to be like, we got it. Okay, good. Ship. It might even be an opportunity for people to pre-order more. Like Elon to be like, yeah, just like they're like, oh, if we just put them in the wild, people will think maybe it's actually going to come out soon. And so people get back on and pre-order so they can lock in their pricing or whatever. That's a good angle. I like that possibility. It's definitely like... I don't think we saw this much public testing with any previous Tesla because Model 3 was kind of a surprise development. And Model S gets a refresh once in a bloom. Yeah. So it's like this is a unique instance where they could totally just use it for marketing. Yeah. But yeah, I don't know. So between that and the Roadster. Roadster, I've just given up hope. I think they just never started developing that again. I'm not going to say never. I think there's a drawing on a meeting room whiteboard somewhere. And I think that counts as development. Okay. That's about it. I think we'll see... We'll see to prove me wrong, bro. We'll see the little quad that they drove into the Cybertruck before we see the road. Because the quad that is a hot paint. That is a hot paint. The Cybert Quad or whatever. The Cybert Quad definitely doesn't come out. That's funny. Okay. I think that's a good bet. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, it's like I think this whole NACS thing, insanely good for Tesla because they basically get to become the gas station. Like it's kind of a small... It's a very smart play to have the best infrastructure and then release a car. And then everyone buys the that car because they're the only ones with the good infrastructure. But once you've saturated the market enough, where so many people have Tesla's that it's such a household name, they're bigger than every other car company by far. Then you can be like, okay, we've sold... We're still going to sell cars. But we've kind of like... We're sort of plateauing a little bit. So then switch over to becoming the gas pump. Because now you can like... Even with the magic dock. You know, you have the Tesla app. You can pay Tesla for energy. Tons of people have been wanting to use that networking. Now you just have a price tag and you just let it loose. And then now they get the licensing from NACS, which is going to be basically the standard. They get the gas, the electricity money from like everyone that's charging from... Like they're going to beat... That company is going to the moon. They finally have money. Yeah. Yeah. They can develop like a sports car. Or something. That'd be cool. Like one that they showed off seven years ago? Yeah, 2017. God, that's thinking. I don't want to think about it. I don't want to think about it. It's never happening. Okay. Well, we can end it at that. I think that's probably a good bet. I don't know if we have any stakes for this bet. But I'm the only one on my side of it. So let's not make it too crazy. Yeah, you're... You stand alone. And with that, let's do trivia. Let's finish it up. I have two whiteboards because I have Andrews. I've got one over here. Oh, I need one of those markers. You have one over there. Actually, give me the other one. I'll give you a marker for a whiteboard. Okay. While they get their whiteboards out, Adam and I have an important trivia announcement to make. And that is, we need your help. We have a very exciting trivia special coming out in the next few weeks. But before we can make that episode, we need to know how you feel about tech stuff. So if you go on the Waveform Twitter, if you go in our Discord, the Waveform channel in the MKBHD Discord, you'll see a link to a Google form. Fill it out. If you have a few minutes, it doesn't take that much time at all. It's pretty simple questions. But it will make our next trivia episode even more fun. Can we reveal smarts, but also a lot of data? Can we reveal the format? I think that would be fun. We can reveal the format. I don't know how to do it because John O was like, you can't use the word. We're not going to get sued. All right. Without using the words, do you guys know that game show where Steve the guy with the mustache points out the board and goes, we asked 100 people what they think of this survey says? Yeah. So we're going to do something like that. We just need those people to say the things about tech. We asked 100, and we asked, it's honestly going to be thousands of MKBHD fans. Survey or We can say survey says. Probably. Where are they going to get sued? Y'all. Survey says. Yeah. Mustache man knows people. Yeah. I also want to say how many priority clips have I shown anywhere? I was, I don't remember where I was yesterday. I was somewhere. I was in a restaurant. And Family Feud was playing on the big TV. And for like the four minutes that I was watching, oh wait, not Family Feud. No, no, Family Fight. That's just different. That's the Family Fight is the one in. It's always sunny. Anyway, sorry to keep talking. Yeah, so I was playing on that TV. And I didn't see anyone guessing questions or anything. It was just Steve Harvey dancing with one of the people from one of the families. People love his outtakes. The entire time they were just like dancing. That's the beauty of Steve Harvey as a game show host. Is when he needs to, he can just be like a hawk about the rules. And it'd be like, we're here to play the game. And then other times he's just like messing around. This is my show and I'm going to use my 30 minutes how I want. Yeah. Anyway, it was honestly, he's a game show my show. As a producer of this show, I look up to Steve Harvey immensely. And the team. And it's the team that way. Hopefully, yeah. If you're a lawyer from TVS, please don't come after us. Okay, CBS. TVS. ABC. ShmeBS. Anyway, it's going to be fun. If you answer the questionnaire, there's a link on Twitter. It will be on our discord as well. Show notes. But yeah, so that way we can go like survey says. And then we have like a lot of data, a lot of smarts and also a lot of data. That bell sound for sure. All right. So score of this trivia round. Oh boy. So far, Marquez has 19. Andrew has 18. David. In the lead with 23. Oh, Jesus. Damn. Go, baby. So like a game show to catch up. First question. Twitch is wildly popular for gaming streamers. True. YouTube gaming was launched in 2015. But when was it discontinued and imported into regular YouTube? You will get one point for the year, another point for the month. I do not look confident, Marquez. My trainer thought is. I have a great a free train, meaning it's very slow to get started. But once it's going, I can't really change it. And boys are full of good stuff. Yeah, hopefully it doesn't catch fire. The interrupts traffic everywhere. Spells can chemicals everywhere. Okay, we both said 2017. What was it? 2017. Okay, I said March. I said January. All right. Wow. Great. Oh, it was 2016. It was 2018. It lasted. Yeah, I was surprised. I thought it was September 2018. I almost guessed 2019. I wouldn't have gotten either. I'll ask Andrew later and we'll cut him in here. That's it. You got your answer? Yeah, like so. Flip it and read. 2018. What's correct? For one extra point, do you know the month? August. September. So close. But you got a point next year. Let's go. Three years for a Google product that is pointless is pretty good. Like the Google products that are good usually less at least one more year. Yeah. Anyway, all right. Question number two, WWDC wasn't always called WWDC. It's going to be the weird answer, isn't it? Before that. I'm just writing Geico now. Was it called? A, the Macintosh developers world gathering, MDWG, B, Apple Independent Software Developers Conference, the AISDC, C, the Santa Clara Developers Symposium, SCDS, or D, the Global Electronic and Information Coaters Open House. Geico. Open House. It's one of the two. I think I'm pretty. I'm pretty. When you're making a trivia question, does anyone ever make A the answer? It's kind of like when you're answering multiple tries on a quiz. Like is it ever used by a rule always say like C or B? Yeah. Or D. A, S, A, T, is there? The answer to their A or B unless I'm wrong. So. All right. I said A. B. I said MDWG, which is A, I think. No. It's B. I don't remember what that was, but it's B. Correct. Two points. Two for two. Was the first one where you trying to mess me up with MDW? Yes. Good. Well, this was Alex's question. So one, we wanted to mess you up. And two, I don't know if you noticed, but D spells out Geico. Oh, it did not notice that. It's the, it's like Apple or like Mac related things. So I figured I wanted to keep with that, but the first one being MDW. New Jersey's called Memorial Day Weekend MDW. Oh, I did not know that. I figured then like July 4th. I feel like in Jersey, but that's what I was like, that's a joke. I think it's a joke, but not intended, but sure. Let's go. You know, it was worth getting my entire vacation cancelled and ruined for me to come in and go two for two on trivia this week. So take the lead against Mark. Hopefully the rest of the episode was good without me, but you know, come in clutch here when I can. It's a B. It was B. The Apple Independent Software Developers Con. I know it. Sorry. God, I almost wrote that. I cannot believe you guys didn't pick Geico. That's I wanted to. I wrote it first, but I crossed it out. When Adam and I wrote this question, we decided Geico should be an answer and then spent so much time with the source. Trying to make it work. What was B again? It was the Apple Independent Software Developers Con. That's actually, okay, that makes more sense. My reasoning was that at the time that this started, Mac was probably the only thing you could develop for applications for, but because like the, I mean, on the iPod, you couldn't make applications for the iPod. Well, this was also in 1983. Yeah. It was the first one. There wasn't an iPhone. Only the Mac was out. Oh, I see. That's why I thought it was. The Mac came out in 1984. Because it had the famous commercial, 1984 won't be like, I think. No, that was that was that wasn't the first Mac though. They had like the Lisa. They made the 19. But the Lisa is not a Mac. It's the Lisa. Oh, good point. Did they not even have the Mac name? That's interesting. I'm pretty sure the Lisa came out in 1983. It was pretty sure that the 84 Apple release was like the Mac. What products did they have that you could develop for at that time? They had the Lisa. They had the Apple 2. They had. So I shouldn't have put Mac in the name, of course. Because I was thinking like, if you wanted to scale for an X period of time, you need to have an ambiguous enough that it's just like we are developing things. Not it's connected to a product. So I shouldn't have said A, but I've. But we did. Anyway, I did. That's the thing we did. That's okay. Maintain my lead, but just not be even more maintaining it. You know, that's okay. I don't think Andrew's going to get that one. I'm fine. I'm okay. Anyway, anyway, we'll run those by Andrew and see if he gets them right. But until the next episode, thanks for watching. And we'll catch you the next one. Peace. Peace. Weightform is a. Open was produced by Adam. Wait, wait, wait. That's how it starts, right? Okay. Weightform is pretty. Weightform is produced by Adam Alita and Ellis Roven. We are partnered with the box media podcast network and our intro after music. Is that not what it is? It's a part of the box media. Weightform is produced by Ellis Roven and Adam Alina. That's what we are part of the. It's Adam Alina Ellis Roven. We're from is produced by Adam Alina and Ellis Roven. We are part of the box media podcast network network. New work. Interesting. I don't know. Weightform is produced by Adam. Weightform? Ah! This is this. Throw them. Yeah, I can't point. Weightform is produced by Adam Alina and Ellis Roven. We are part of the box media podcast network and our intro outro music is created by Vain Soe. Great. Weight is created in it or is it just by? I say it enough.\\\"\": -0.02915404550731182, \"\\\" Alright, what is up, people of the internet. Welcome back to another episode of the Wayform podcast. Rehose, I'm Arquez, I'm Andrew, and I'm David. And we've compiled, we've been taking notes this whole week about what we wanted to talk about, and it's turned out this is mostly a social media episode. We have a lot to say about a lot of different social networks. Starting with Google+, of course, is the hottest one, just kidding. YouTube, fighting some things, Twitter, fighting some things, Reddit fighting some things, Instagram fighting some things. But first, we want to talk about the Zenphone. You've been actually using the Zenphone alongside. I have been telling that. I can officially say so I've been using this for about two weeks now. I want to preface this by saying, also, this is the first non-pixel phone I've used since the Pixel 3. The 3 is when I switched to the Pixel lineup, and I've only used Pixel since then. So this is a fairly close to stock Android phone. Yes. How have you been finding the Zenphone 10? I will start it by saying I really appreciate, oh, you have all the fun colors. I was just showing the colors. What, five colors this time? Yeah, five colors. Blue, white, black, green, red. Yes. Blue is hot. Blue is hot. And by hot, I mean, really subtle. It's really cool actually. Yeah. It is really quite bright. That's warm. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. The green is like a bright, pine green. Yeah. I've been using the green. I think we kind of were wondering if which one is going to fade the worst because remember the Zenphone 9 had like a terrible fading. I do think this back material is going to not fade as bad. They said they made the material better from last year, right? Yes. Yeah. Actually, I'll just said that. Yeah. So I'll start by just my like summary of the phone, which is I love the Zenphone 9 shamelessly. Like just one of my favorite phones ever. It won my small phone of the year last year. And I could only really come up with maybe two nitpicks about that phone. One is it didn't have wireless charging. They added it to this phone. So it's got 30 watt, 30 watt wired, 15 watt wireless boom. They did that. Epic. The other nitpick was the back material just like faded so hard. I had a red phone within a month. Keep in mind you own a phone for years. Within a month, my phone was like dark and used looking like really. Yeah. I'm like a year, two years, three years. This phone is going to look crazy. I mean, it probably bottoms off after a while. But that was that was a legitimate pick I had. This phone still feels kind of the same like it's a soft punch. It's got a little texture to it, but they told me it's a different material. So I said, Oh, okay, it's a different material. It hopefully is a better aging, more durable material. And so far, that's felt like it's held up to be true as well. So I no longer have anything negative to say at all about this phone. It's great. It just has like the tiniest littleest nitpicks for me. Yeah. It's phone is incredible. I mean, that's kind of how I feel. I those two things I agree with, I said the wireless charging was a deal breaker for me. And I was like, man, if this had wireless charging, how would you use it? And here we are. I'm using it. And I do agree. I've, I mean, I take this to the climbing gym and catch charcoal over it. I throw it on the ground. I've seen very little wear on the back of it. And the greens really light. So I feel like it could show where very easily. I was hoping I had it with me on, you know, some hiking over the last week, but I didn't. So I didn't get to see if it got that dirty from there. Those of you out of the loop, Andrew, I said was on vacation when we recorded last week, but then his flight got canceled. And now it's a different. It was terrible. So he's back. He's back. We're rescheduling it. But we're back. I'm happy to be here. And, but yeah, so so far, like you said, I've loved it. It has wireless charging. The size I'm getting used to because I'm not used to something small, which I think let's take a minute. We were arguing about this beforehand. What did you say? Someone said on YouTube. But what? So there were a lot of comments. I don't know if it was from your tweet when it would got announced or something. But a lot of people are saying, like, this is a misconception. This is not a small phone. We are talking about relative to any other, mostly phone, any other Android phone you can get right now. It's like one of the smallest ones, specifically with flagship specs. It is definitively. I'm pretty sure I can say it's definitively the smallest phone with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Yeah. And it is definitely the smallest flagship phone you can get. Yeah. The iPhone SE is technically slightly smaller. Yeah. But that's not a flagship phone. As someone who's used a lot of phones to like, when I type on this phone, the keyboard feels a little bit small sometimes. Do you have it? Wait, wait. Before we go forward, I also think one of the complaints of that though was comparing it to the iPhone mini. When it is closer, it is closer to the size of a regular iPhone than the iPhone mini, but it was being compared to that just because it is one of the smaller Android devices. Yeah. iPhone is a smaller iOS device. The iPhone mini, that's what the older made. Yes. When it was out, it was by a landslide, the smallest flagship phone you could get. Yeah. Currently, it is small. Is what we're trying to say? It is a small phone. It is my front runner for smallest, best small phone of the year again right now. Do you think this would be a front runner for just overall best phone of the year? So here's what gets interesting. Or best value. So I think yes, for best value. Six, ninety nine, right? Yes. The same price last year. Awesome. Awesome value. Literally incredible battery life. Yeah. Really good cameras. I think in order to be like an overall MVP best phone, it's a little more blurry. I think you could argue on impact or on overall sentiment about a phone. Yes, it's right there. But I would also want slightly better cameras. I would want. You know, like I think the cameras are good. But I think there be plus to a minus good where the absolute cream of the crop, the S23 ultra is the ones that have a telephoto camera, the iPhone 14 Pros, the Pixel Pro. Those are going to be a bit better. I mean, it doesn't have a telephoto. I think that's just one thing it's lacking and it's a small phone and that would be a lot of room to take up. But it's not like a flagship camera system. It's right underneath one. So it's not going to be the best phone of the year, but it is good at everything it does. Yeah. Also as a headphone jack. I just want to do a quick rundown of like what's inside this phone, right? Yeah. Snapdragon HN2 wireless charging. It's 5.9 inches, 144 hertz, IP68, headphone jack, 30 watt charging, like very durable. It's got basically everything that anyone ever asked for. And the fact that the battery life is so good when it takes no sense. So I'll say for my battery life, it's the middle of the day. I'm at 47%. That's because I haven't charged it since yesterday. It's incredible. It's really. I'm a day and half in it almost half that. You said 144 hertz. I will mention it is almost never 144 hertz. Okay. So you can put it at auto and it will go up to 144 hertz only when game genie has told it that it is playing a game that can take advantage of a hundred twenty four. Not even on like the home screen. Not only. Yeah. It's 120 all the time. Well, I don't care. So it's just like they get to say 144 on the press materials, but it's 120. I mean, 120 is perfectly fine. That's a great photo. This is low light at Coney Island the other. That's a really good picture or low light photo. Yeah. I was very impressed. I've always really liked Asus' cameras. Even when I did like the Zenfone 5 or 6 review way back in the day, they don't lean super hard into like computational photography HDR stuff, which I think is a strong suit for them. Because it gives them a little more contrast or a little sharper. There's less noise reduction. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're they do well in the test every year as well. Yeah. It is potentially one of the top four or five phones in this blind or get like gets knocked out by the winner and puts up a fight against it, which is I think a lot of people would argue like, Oh, so okay, why is it not one of the best flagship cameras? It still has to compete with ultra wide slasking compete with telephoto. So it has to compete with video. It does have it has no telephoto. It does have really, really great stabilization. Right. Which should be obvious if you look at the giant camera module almost to the point where it's like it's like too finicky about being like, no, no, you weren't perfectly still. Maybe you should take that picture again and I'll look at it and be like, no, it's totally fine. But now I'm worried about it. I remember I just remember walking around just taking like handheld video, just like normal not thinking too hard about it. And I played it one played it back. It was just like normal 4K 30, not even the Super smooth mode. And it was just remarkably smooth. And I was like, this is as good as I'd want it. It's really good. Yeah. Six nine and I still am like, how did they get the 699 price point? That's crazy. So it's not going to sell well. This is my thing is like, and actually Aaron, he made a video where most of his video was about how this phone won't sell well. And I kind of tend to agree. But I am so happy that ASUSS continued to spend on and make money or to make the effort to make this phone good and small. Because it takes extra work and extra engineering to fit it in a small space and still make it so good. And it's going to be in the US this year. They're actually going to launch a quarter three. That's epic. Which is cool. I don't know if it's going to be in a bunch of carrier stores or maybe just one or two. That would be nice. But yeah, it's it's not going to over sell the big screen. Because what do people like buying big screen? Big screen. So yeah, I don't know. Claire's using an S10E and she was like, I want this as my next phone. S10E is a really good parallel because this also has the fingerprint reader power button. It really is. Oh my god. This is the S10E. Yeah, stays with the headphone jack. Yeah. S10E also have the corner. Whole punch. Remember the big hero six wallpaper we use. That's a good parallel. Yeah. But overall, love it. It's getting I took me a little while to get used to a smaller phone because I've always used bigger ones. My tiny gripes are the fingerprint sensor I missed under the screen just because when I grab it with my left hand, even though I've used my pointer finger as a phone, you can use but you can only launch apps in it in floating windows, which I just like let me open a full full screen app from that because I like to it's like a quick it's like a one-handed mode. Yeah, it's like the quick actions from the side and you can either do like settings toggles on it or also apps, but they're only. So then you have to open it and then like click the big button because I hate using windowed apps on a phone. Got it. It's just not my on an already small phone. I don't know. Maybe the idea is that it's sort of like our career like opening a window temporarily and then you're closing it quickly. Exactly. I think like the best version would be like you're you have an app already and you're like I need to throw the calculator app up and do it really quick and then like click out of there. That's kind of cool. That makes sense. It's a cool idea. I just don't. Yeah. If it was full screen, that seems like a really simple addition. The kadoo would be awesome to be able to do that every time. We like toggles. At toggles. What was the pixel fold thing? It's the same thing. Give me the option to have a separately out on the inside and outside just to just to toggle. Yeah, just that doesn't have to be on by default. Just let me toggle it. Yeah. Yeah. We like Android because it's customizable like. Same as simple. We like toggles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Morrow's. All right. Moving on. YouTube is testing blocking a video entirely if you have an ad blocker installed. I wouldn't run about. This is the thing about these headlines is whenever I see a headline that says YouTube is testing, yeah. I kind of just wait because YouTube tests a lot of crazy things. Yeah. A lot of some things do make it. YouTube was testing or moving a dislike counter and it made it to the top and they disliked it. YouTube was testing, you know, some other weird things that eventually made it to the top. But YouTube also tests like insane things that they just want to see if it'll work with like a fraction of a percent of people. And then it goes away. So I don't know how far in the testing process this one has made it. It seems like it's still not fully rolled out. But yeah, you know, social media companies like to protect the way they make money. So I mean, you have an ad blocker. You're not making them any money. That's the thing. How many things do they test that are directly affecting their bottom line? Like YouTube offers an insane amount of stuff with free video uploads and essentially unlimited space for anybody. So like they need to make money. And I'm not going to sit here and like totally defend YouTube. They have plenty of money. But it's their whole business. Exactly. I would be pretty surprised if this doesn't push forward. Yeah. Yeah. I will also say, I've had YouTube premium for so long that I forgot their ads on YouTube. I was guilty of that for a while to you. And I know that for one person, it's kind of expensive. But you can have up to six people in your Google family plan. And it's only like $3.80 a month per person if you have all sex people in your family. It's funny how we think about these prices. It's only $3.80 for no ads on an unlimited video supply of the entire internet. You don't have to go to college for $3.80. That's it. You one person has to pay and everyone pays them back. Yeah. Just checking. Yeah. It's the smart way of doing it. Yeah. For YouTube. You didn't just hear that. No. No. We are we are family. We are family to describe how it it seems like they're testing it though. Essentially, if you were to try and play a video with an ad blocker on rather than immediately just block videos entirely, it they give you like three chances with a screen that says like they designed a whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. Because they want to like push people towards like why they're doing this. And it says it looks like you may be using an ad blocker. Playback will be blocked unless YouTube is allowed on the is disabled on the ad blocker list or you can use YouTube premium. So trying to push it towards that also with a like creator still get paid from your subscription. So more along the lines of like help your creator friends. Yeah. Yeah. This is exact. Yeah. But also us. Yeah. I will say like it felt like the earlier internet we everyone was like add suck like get away from ads like get them you know use ad blockers. Well, I think people are a little more open to like seeing ads because we kind of zone them out a little bit more now like even banner ads on websites like I don't even really notice anymore. And then like YouTube video. The thing with YouTube video ads though is I was so used to not seeing them for so long. And then sometimes I go into incognito mode to watch YouTube video because I don't want it to have a lot of ads. Yeah. At the beginning double ads at the beginning they're both 30 seconds. I'm like yeah. So there's like a three minute video and I'm watching one minute of ads. Yeah. I more and more of how the internet is working is without paid creators. Those ads is like you're not getting the people creating those. So like if it was going to meta I would like block the ads. But if it's going to creators I'm like yeah. It's going to creators or like if you think of your favorite tech blog like nine to five Mac or a bird or something like that. It's like I'm going to put those on my like I use an ad block but I also use the the white list feature very like cognizantly of like making sure that the people I want to keep reading are white listed from that so they make money and I can keep reading because so many places are shutting down now because they're losing money and I'm sure a lot of those places are scared of these AI things taking all their information. Yeah. And this is this is even beyond just online video like we just saw a whole bunch of ESPN layoffs. How many ads do you see on ESPN? Like when you watch TV aren't there like four consecutive minutes of ads or something like that for every 10 minutes to TV something crazy yeah. And they're still like yeah we're out of money for you sorry. I know that like SpongeBob episodes they have two episodes or they've won episode and fit within a 15 minute block but then like four or five minutes of that is ads. So a SpongeBob episode is actually like 11 minutes long. Wow. I think that's like the most television. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of episodes. Yeah. It's crazy. Like when you watch a 30 minute TV episode you only watch to 21 minute. Yeah. And most of like a lot of ads. Yeah. I feel so old that we're explaining how commercials and SpongeBob was as kids like and that kids there are people out listening to this that don't understand. Yeah. So for those of you who don't know there's a thing called linear television where you don't get to choose where you are in the video ever it's just playing non-stop and you don't get to hit pause. Well I guess maybe you could which is what like Pluto TV is now. But then unscrupible ads would just play back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to basketball ads. Yeah. Then you just call that. Commercial break. That's what it's called. Yeah. It's like when we go to break but we don't really have commercials. Well sometimes we do I guess. Well speaking of breaks let's take a quick ad break. Wow. And then we'll come back and we'll talk more about social media. But of course we have this little fun thing that we do for ad breaks which is trivia. Trivia. It's way better than SpongeBob. Here you're minus the score. The score. Andrew is wondering. Andrew got a lot of play plans to make. He wants to press that. There you go. Mark has 19 David with 23. Andrew with 20. 20 club. Rude. This is gonna be rough. I lose both the names. I put that for later. Mark has I wouldn't have done that high five if I had known that he was just trying to put you in the 24. All right first question. So what was the first commercially available smartphone with wireless charging? Seeing as the Zenfone 10 now has wireless charging. What was the first one? I'm gonna enjoy not being last for this one episode. I have a general idea. It's wrong. Okay. Ad break. I support for this podcast comes from Babel.

Rosemary's restrictions apply. All right, welcome back. So I have a question and David, I promise this will make sense in a minute, but it might be confusing right now. Marquez. Like a free agency happened. It did last week. It popped off. Any where there any like cool fun things, big trades, blockbuster trades, like interest, finding hard to follow at all. Inter is literally being like, David, I know you don't know sport, but it will make sense. It will roll into something we all understand. Do you know when Gretzky was the other day? I'm not going to ask you paid attention to free agency. Continue. That's fair. Yeah. No, there's some good trade. I'm just saying I'm a little hurt. Chris Paul got waved and he was a he was technically a Washington wizard. Yeah, a few days. And now he's a he's on the warriors, which is fascinating because he was like their biggest, not biggest. You're a big Chris Paul fan. Yeah, he was the rival and I was going to play for them. So your warriors now? Well, I'll keep watching them play. It's tough being a West Coast, sorry, I'm tangling already. West Coast basketball fan because all the games start at 10, 10, 30 games. Yeah, I'm going better like 2 a.m. Yeah, I want to watch some East Coast teams this year, but yeah, there were some moves. Have you heard of the next? The New York Knicks. Yeah, I've heard of them. We did make a good signing though. Did you? Yeah. I would even need a chance. I don't even chance. I think he's going to run your whole team. No, no, no, no, no, but we got the like core crew now from the villain, yeah, from the villain, no, but team that won. So like, I like it. It's fun. It's going to keep winning naturally. So question. When you're following free agency, how do you follow Alex? Alex. Shout out to Lockdown Dixie. Yeah, Alex is honestly. It's usually Twitter or or all open Instagram and it'll refresh and they'll be a Rose post at the top. Oh, yeah, Rose is like it was funny. He, I sorry. So there's this guy. It's not a real thing. Adrian, Rose, I don't know. I'm going to butcher's name. What is it? What is it? He's a crazy reporter that he knows things before the players. So he tweeted out like a week ago about one player that was like not getting their contract extended or something like that. And that player was like, thanks for the heads up. I had no idea. Oh, man. Yeah. So he knows things. He's the same way. Well, so the reason you might be wondering why we're talking about this. Yes. To me, the two best ways to follow free agency, I'm an NHL fan, not an NBA fan, but they they're like exact similar. Yeah. This all happens on July 1st. And I follow all of it through Reddit and Twitter, which July 1st, Reddit and Twitter, were very hard to follow on. Oh, because Reddit lost all third party apps on July 1st. They all closed down. And Twitter had a fun little rate limit feature. Whatever you want to call it. They started the day of July 1st for both of them. So I would like to talk about both of these and how annoying they were. Where do we start? Yeah. Which would you like to talk about first? Twitter Reddit. First, I would like to say I do not know sports. But I think that we should talk about Reddit first for no reason. I agree with that reason. Cool. We talked brief. Well, we talked to in length about. Yes. What Reddit is doing. Yeah. In the previous episode. Yeah. The update is that now they've gone through with actually new. We got to the limit. So when they had to pay the bill, right? Yes. They didn't nuke. So they turned on the API cost thing. Not all third party apps shut down. No. I believe bacon reader is still around and said they are switching to a paid only option very soon. Or that was that relay for Reddit. I'm still using a relay and I've had no updates. Okay. Relay is still like on the fence. But I think the most recently thing I saw about them is that they're like, it's probably going to cost about $7 a month, which might mean just shut down because that's expensive to ask for. Yeah. I think we would probably pay that much. Yeah. I would probably not want to pay more than five. But I would. Seven's a lot of money. Seven's a lot of money per month. But if you think about what has to go through Play Store and App Store and by the time they make it back to pay for these stupid API changes, they're not totally sure yet. But Apollo, Sync and Reddit is fun. All shut down. They were gone end of June 30th over with. And I just had to say because of free agency, I had to use the default app for a little bit. And I previously had mentioned that it's very bad. And now after using it for a weekend, I think I need to make a small correction on that. It's really bad. It is so much worse than I thought it was. It is horrible. It is the worst experience. I think I've ever dealt with it. It's pretty bad. And app, I just like, have you used the default app? I have managed to avoid it so far. Yeah. Almost goodness. Look at scrolling through this. I'm in dark mode. Okay. I'm also in airplane mode. So that might take a second. It's not letting any of you. I also want to make it. I want to make it a quick correction that bacon reader did fully shut down. But did it relay for Reddit is still around for now. But they will be moving to a subscription model in the coming weeks. I'm so underkeeping it. The developer is trying to get there. The API calls that they're using. It's down as low as possible. So they can charge as little as possible. Yeah. But we'll find out soon. How much that actually is. I've got a couple updates in the Play Store. And every time I see an update for really Reddit, I'm like, oh no, what is it? I looked out. I load up the notes. And it just says API optimization. So I'm like, oh, okay. Wow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it still works. Yeah. So this is I just loaded up the hockey subreddit. It has a pin post at the top. Look at in dark mode. You like can't even tell where a new post starts. Yeah. Do you see how bad this looks? Then a potential full page ad. Wasn't ad. This is an ad. Oh, full page. I was a full page video ad. And then just like these terrible. It's just everything. Look. That's a full page video ad. Yeah. I mean, I'm not logged in, which I think would still be people. How many ads there are? It's horrible. Is it just been my normal Reddit experience? Well, it sounds like that's probably why you don't like Reddit very much. If you're on Android, use Relay for Reddit, it's in my opinion one of the best Reddit apps that's ever been made. And it's free. It's still free for now. So for now, weirdly enough, oh, it's free for now. I was using a relay pro, I guess. Yeah. Because I paid for it. Yeah, it's still free for now, but they're going to be moving to a subscription model. They've announced the price yet. But they must be doing pretty well if they can take that time because they're going to charge. They're starting to. Yeah, I paid for Relay pro, but it was a one-time fee. So yeah, same. Yeah, a couple books. It was $3. And then I think there's still $3.7 years ago. Yeah. Switch over. The scary part about all of this though is that like the more people that go over to these apps that didn't have as big of a user base before, the more it's going to cost them. Jump in and then more like it might just don't use real. Also, it's awful. It's awful. What are you saying? It's awful. Weirdly enough, Claire has read it as fun on her phone and it still works. I read. I don't know how. I read something that like there was some weird setting that Reddit has fun still works for for some reason. But it's going to get patch soon. It's going to get destroyed soon. I'm sure. Well, she was, she told me she's like, I've been using Reddit. I was like, no, you haven't. And she's like, no, no, I'm fine. He's like, you just haven't refreshed it yet. Like you probably, it's just old stuff. Then she refreshes it right in front of me. I was like, can I borrow this for a minute? I've got to get my fix in. So right now, pretty much what I'm doing is I have the default app if I want to like really look at something. But because I'm not logged in in the default app for me to go try and read comments on Reddit is like, a chore. So I don't find myself like freely scrolling through it anymore. Okay. So it logs you out, but it still works. So it just Claire. So yeah, apparently she doesn't log in to any. Apparently it's read it as fun. Currently is like basically just accessing the old dot Reddit like public website and using that data somehow. Yeah. It says most likely using the dot json API, which is still available anonymously. So you can't, you can't be logged in and use it. Which is annoying. So it's basically just like a different interface to read the website. I guess. With it being logged in. If you're poinlin, like if you're trying to go to a certain subreddit, I guess that still would work. Okay. Because then you can just you have to search every time to be friends. This is as of four days ago. So maybe Reddit patched it and yeah, now they're shut down. So it'll probably be on there. But I mean like ultimately. Yeah, yeah, following me to see your NFL free agency on Reddit would have been pretty tough. This is like impossible. But then there's Twitter. But then there's Twitter. There's Twitter. Which is great. All right. So the Twitter thing that happened was on July 1st, a lot of people might have seen this little notification pop up that says rate limit exceeded. And did any of you guys get it? I did. Not. But I did it. The first thing when I woke up in the morning, I opened Twitter and I saw it. I think it's within like 24 hours or whatever. So I probably hit it till day before and then it went into effect. Great notification prompt for people that have no idea what that means. Great job, Elon. But basically they set this limit so that you can only read a certain number of posts. And they also for some reason made it so it was a different amount for Twitter blue users. It was 10 times the the amount for Twitter blue users. It started as 600 for non blue users and 6000 for blue users. They are increasing it more and more over time. Elon said it was temporary. We'll see if it's temporary. Yeah. They also didn't tell anyone to 1 p.m. Eastern like the whole morning and like like I said, this is NBA and NHL free agency. There were like some of the biggest reporters that I follow trying to see stuff. They're just like, well, I guess you can look at all this on my my space page because like this is not working. And those people need to scour the internet to look for breaking news. And Twitter is supposed to be the site of breaking news. And now you're living in. I think that the reason that they turn this on was that they are trying to figure out what AI companies are scraping Twitter without using the paid API because you can do that without using the paid API using scraping services. And technically, it'll just like run through tweets really rapidly. So you'll hit a wall really quickly. Whether or not they actually like make it a temporary thing or if they just have it for a very long period of time because they need to keep catching these companies. I have no idea. Yeah. That does a similar excuse to what Steve often said. It is. Which I think that's a like I didn't get to the legitimate excuse. Agreed. Yeah. But it sucks that like this new era of technology is coming in and it's basically completely destroying all the other stuff. Yeah. It's destroying a lot of other users. I'm sure Woj hit his hit his rate limit for the day. Well, the thing about Woj is he's he's on the phone. He's getting his info and then he's just tweeting it. And so everyone who's trying to follow and refresh and find the latest stuff will hit their limits probably if they're not logged in or whatever. But yeah, that's it is it's kind of like we constantly see Google and YouTube like fighting their demons of like people trying to take advantage of this site in Twitter's case. It's people scraping or AI services scraping in YouTube's case a lot of times it's spammers and scammers and things like that people making fake accounts. So I could imagine like the brute force version of this on YouTube would be like you left too many YouTube comments rate limit exceeded and you're like what what do you mean rate limit exceeded I like going around and leaving comments on things. Yeah, it's like well spammers just go around and leave thousands of comments on things. So if we just set a hard cap before we think about it at all that's at least a way to stop scammers from being so effective. Yeah. And this is Twitter's version of that. It's like wow people are going around scraping all of Twitter pulling thousands of things off the site and whatever they're doing with it we're not getting paid. Yeah. So we'll just set a hard limit and that's temporary. We'll figure out a better way to do something else about it later in the future. But for now some regular users are going to hit that limit too and oh well. Also all the tech vcs have all been like if you're hitting the rate limit then you need to go outside and touch grass. That was and the funny thing about that is like bro you own this app like the point you are clearly just using that as an excuse because you're you're trying to make us use the app as much as possible. So you can't just like turn around it is kind of funny that people want us to use the app. My app is too toxic for you. So you should go outside like all right. I feel like like Elons was like we're not going to tell anyone and they're going to just think Twitter broke. Yeah. Then at one o'clock I'm going to tell people it's a very small number and then everyone's going to complain and then an hour later I'm going to be like well hold up we'll increase it and then another hour later is like okay we'll increase it more and then right after that is like touch grass losers and she's like what is going on how is this the PR cycle of Twitter? That's the Elon cycle. That's pretty much consistent with everything that's ever happened negatively to him. Interesting. Yeah. It's just though I don't know. I can't believe you don't announce it at first because everyone was very confused. They just thought Twitter was going down. Like they thought it was one of those days where Twitter was just not going to quite work. It's a funny thing because some of these it's funny that this coincidence it's like the how do I say this? YouTube also never tells anyone about the changes that it makes to stops bammers and scammers. All the hour and make changes it's a black box. All the rule changes about things like that that you can't do with an account that you just made. When we made a brand new account for this podcast we tried to upload and it took like 24 hours to process. I'm sure that's another rule we don't know about but the reason they never announced those rules is so that those spammers and scammers cannot read the rulebook and go how do I get around this? Because that's a guidebook for how you get around all those rules. Yeah. But it's a weird coincidence that with Twitter this limit also coincided with regular users use where like a regular user could just be reading tweets and then hit the limit. We're like most of the things with YouTube it's like you can't leave 300 comments in an hour. Yeah. Okay well if you did you'd think YouTube broke. Reddit couldn't leave any more comments. Yeah most regular people are never going to do that. Reddit has had that built in since like the beginning. Like you can't leave like more than like three comments within like 10 minutes or something. Yeah. Or it goes oh that's kind of spammer make more than that may post with 10 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah I'm sure you can't you know change your profile picture 10 times in 10 minutes. I'm sure there's a lot of things we don't know that you can't do on YouTube and Twitter. It's just this one happens to be something that regular people are like wait what I hit the limit what I'm just acting normal what's going on. Yeah when you do views on a thing that's just you're scrolling through hundreds and hundreds of like posts in comments like going through one post in their comments like you're hitting 100. When somebody gets traded I scroll through all the reaction tweets so fast there's like hundreds of games about the guy that gets just got traded it's yeah it's pretty easy. I haven't hit the limit yet but I imagine it's not that I hate it. Although you're verified I'm verified so 600 like when it first happened 600 posts you're kidding I'm not even out of bed. I'm I'm through a thousand posts before I even step my feet on the floor. Touch grass. Touch grass. Yeah. Yeah that was just it was a hectic day and it happened on a day where like Twitter and Reddit were very important I was very sad and you know I really feel like both of these has just turned into me using them far less on my phone which probably is a good thing. It's actually yeah it's probably old. It's not really good. Touching grass. It's terrible for them to make money but it's yeah the ultimate goal of all these social media companies is to make as much money as possible basically I'm so simplifying but like they want to make as much money as possible and if the mechanic of them making money is you spend more time on the site so you see more ads. Yeah. Then anything they do that's counter to that seems hilariously dumb. Yeah. So this seems pretty stupid. You're getting people to leave the site faster thus making less money. Yeah. They'll figure it out. Also on July 1st there were like massive surges of signups to mastodon and to blue skies. Oh this happens every time there's a weird future. Yeah. Literally anytime there's any sort of weird thing on Twitter you get like some surge and stir on all these sites. Yeah. Mastodon, T2, everything. Yeah. Probably not to talk about those after the break. We got to get to Twitter competitors, right? That's another own section. Oh yeah. And a fresh one. So we got some new things to talk about there. Yeah. But before we get there let's take one more quick break and let's do a trivia question. All right. Trivia question number two. Really hoping I know this one. Maybe maybe not. In the 2022 blind smartphone camera test. I should know this one. The Pixel 6A one first place. What phone came in third? Oh third? Well so there's two. You did see there's two phones that are tied for third or is there? Oh yeah. I got to get a time or yellow rating. What in 20? Oh because there's 22. Yeah. We didn't just kidding. No, we did do yellow. There is a third. So is it in which category overall overall? Overall, overall third highest. Yes. Okay. I should know this. Oh so all three of them put together. What? There's a standard photo, a low light photo and a portrait standard? No, he had overall. He did it. There was overall overall. Yeah. You know, I should know this. I should know this. One and I remember second place. Dang. Okay. Well second place. There's Pixel 6 Pro. Was it? Or was it not? I lived in the sheet for like two weeks. Seven pro. I know the bottom one. Be sure that was second. Be sure that was second. Yeah. I appreciate it. Almost Pixel 7 third. Seven pro. We didn't have a seven. All right. Time for break. Time for break. All right. Welcome back. So Mark, as you said, this new app you're trying is a four-shore Twitter killer. You said Twitter is probably going to be done by the end of the week. I think that's what you said off camera. That's what some advocates would interpret my statement as. Oh, but I'll read what I wrote. I'm going to expand on it. How about that? Sure. Like that. Okay. So what I tweeted and just for background, Twitter, mostly text-based, I think we can agree. It's it. Yeah. A lot. The number one thing Twitter has over Blue Sky and Macedon and T2 and all these other competitors has always been the people. That's what makes meta launching their Twitter competitor threads. So interesting. They'll pour it everyone's Instagram handles over and we'll just have people right away. And I tweeted that. I hit send. Got a lot of Instagram replies. I am currently using threads. I have the app on my phone. I'm in the early access group. It's going to go live right before this podcast goes up. So we will also be using threads by the time you will hear this. Follow us on threads. It's another one. But I think that's the interesting thing. And I guess I'll expand it to two things actually. The thing that Twitter has had over T2, Macedon, Blue Sky is infrastructure and people. Yeah. Infrastructure, I just say because they're a real company. And when I look at T2, they're slowly building features and bug fixing and they don't have an app yet. And we're going to figure out how to do DMs in the next month. They're really early. I don't think you can even block someone on T2 yet. Macedon is down all the time. Blue to be say what you want about Twitter, but they implement stuff for real and fast. Even if you hate what they're doing. Maybe two. Sometimes. So that's one thing. And meta has that. meta has that in spades. They're a real company that can make a real app with real features. And as soon as I use threads, I'm like, yeah, they built Twitter. They've got Reese shares. They've got DMs. They've got posts. They've got sharing images and videos. They've got profiles. They've built the connection with Instagram. They've just built it and they they have the infrastructure to keep building things. So that's number one. And the number two, I think we obviously Twitter doesn't have a ton of people compared to Facebook, whatever. I think it's maybe 300 million versus however many billion. But it does have a lot of like real people that people care about following. They've got athletes. They've got artists. They've got creators like us. They've got politicians. They've got all these sports teams. TV shows are all on Twitter. And mastodon T2, blue sky. There's a couple here and there. Like you might log in and be like, oh, cool. Like Oprah's on mastodon. Like I don't know. Randomly you'll see like a couple things pop up. But to me, it was always like, well, Twitter has everybody already. So even if the features are a little bit weird, at least that's where the people are and that's what I'm here for. And meta also has that because Instagram, Facebook, the social graph is built in. And I guess what's basically happening is when you sign up for threads, you keep your Instagram handle, I guess is how it works. You don't automatically get, you don't automatically follow everyone or get followed by people who follow your Instagram. But at least you have your handle and you're verified already. And they jump in and the people are already there. Like when I was using it pre-release as I've been using it, obviously, you know, Instagram employees, Zuck and Adam Asari and people like that. But also just like a bunch of celebrities are already on it using it kind of just like poking around. And I have a feeling that's just going to grow kind of the same way it was because everyone already uses Instagram and expects that. So those two things, infrastructure and people, they are what made Twitter better than its competitors. And this is the first competitor that's come along that has potentially both of those things right out the gate. And that's why it's interesting to see what happens. I have some questions. Yeah. Okay. Wait, I want to tell a story first. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, this morning David posted a slack saying like, oh, threads is like available and you can go to it and see it. Like it's not out. You can't just download it, but like the website is up. And then Marquez goes in real life, like in real time, yeah, I've been using this for like two or three days. Like in previous and I was like, the real life meme happened to us. Yeah. Like every time, I'm always like, oh, I've some exciting new information. And Marquez is just like, oh, I've been using that for a long time. It's popping. It's popping off over there. I have a ton of, I had to mute my threads notifications for the day because I guess because I got a notification for every everything. Yeah. Okay. So questions. Yeah. Number one, is the, does the app feel like really well built out? Like does it have basically all the same features as Twitter? Good question. So 80% yeah, 80% of all the stuff you'd expect. And I think they're probably going to add stuff that Twitter doesn't already have. So there is no like for you page, but there's like the sort of the homepage. I thank God. Can we see that? Yeah, you can. Let me, let me, let me screen record me. Yeah. Yeah. Screen record. So just to walk through the UI, there's the homepage, just like Twitter, you can like something, you can comment on something. Well, this looks exactly like it's quite something you can attach an image. Oh, you can do image sharing. It does crash in iOS 17 beta when I try to image share. So I'll say that. Yeah, it's just on the iPhone. But there is a media, you can share photos and videos. There's a search function so you can find new users and it does suggest a bunch. So look, oh, Gordon Ramsey's at the top. I can click in. He's got an avatar. He's got one thread. I can follow him. Cool. There's Compose, which is just a Compose window. There are likes and all your activity. So replies, mentions, verified, and your profile. Wait, Verif. Oh, no. So there is already a sorting mechanism for just people who are verified. They're building in this whole metavarified thing into this aren't they? Oh, yeah. 100%. Yeah. They're definitely going to do that. So that's it's all here. It's all. It's all working. Other question. Yeah. How high quality is the photo and video upload? Because Instagram is crap and Twitter before it got bought by Elon made a very strong push to make photo quality really good. And I really love that about Twitter. But Twitter never had any sort of like they have a media page, but they don't have like a curated like gallery page. Yeah. And something that I was hoping because this is like an Instagram sub product in a way, I was hoping maybe there would be some sort of like gallery linkage to your Instagram or something. Haven't seen that. Okay. And I actually haven't really pixel peep too much on the image quality either. I'll look into that. Because Instagram has a really low image quality. Yeah. Yeah. Everything is pixel everything you you fine tune detail and color and everything. Then you post it and you're like, what happened to my my precious. Yeah. Exactly. That's that may still be true about this. But yeah, they really didn't do any sort of features that Twitter hasn't done. Okay. So there aren't like a YouTube studio or like a Twitter analytic studio or anything crazy like that. There isn't like a new gallery view for images. They haven't really gone at crazy or done anything like super innovative. But they have built the bare bones like pieces of a text based social media. Do you know how many photos you can upload at once and what the video max time is? I have only tried to upload one and I have only seen people upload one. And I don't know what the max time is. But I only one if you can't upload like four at least that's. Yeah, four. I've only seen one. Can you try to do multiple right now and see what happens? So it crashes anytime I try. Right. I might not mind that work. But let's go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, add seven crash. It just crashes instead. Yeah. Again, the basics. Okay. It's got the basics. I would love to do like 10 photos. That would be amazing. Because the four the four max on Twitter has also been kind of annoying to me. You could thread it. Well, I think on Instagram, you can do a carousel of what eight 10 10 and on lemon eight, you can do a carousel of I believe eight or 10. That's not real. So I think they'll probably do that at some point. But right now, I think really it's just about like the social graph and the interestingness of it being a new place where all the people you already know are hanging out. Yeah. Kind of the main thing that's interesting. Looking at it right there, it looks like Twitter. And that's a great thing. Yes, it's great to be honest. Because exactly like you said, there are people already on it. It looks and seems like it's acting just like Twitter like scrolling through it. I'm just seeing random thoughts with gift replies and a place to look at my activities and a place to follow people in a way to look at my own profile. Like the notification page looks nice. You can split it up between verified users and all replies and just replies or likes and stuff like that. And it's also interesting. I separated replies from mentions. So if it's a new post that mentions you, that's one. That's really good. Why to something you posted. That's a different section. Yeah. Okay. Was I also going to say why I really lost my chance out there? Can you thread things yet? Well, yeah. So what's it calling post? It's called threads. Yeah. And basically every single post has a section where you can jump in and view specifically the replies. So I guess that's their mechanic for it being threads. I haven't been able to thread multiple threads together. I guess it's called threads. Can you like make a thread that has like when you finish you hit like add additional thread or add additional. Well, that's the character limit. Yeah. Is there a character limit? These are all good questions. Cause like I'm assuming if there isn't a way to do that, which is already where it's called a thread. And it feels like you can't thread it like you can on Twitter. So like is there a character? So you can thread it just by like adding it to this. Basically every post has a thread of all the replies underneath it and you can just add to that thread and just shows up in line. So I guess technically that's a thread. Okay. Character limit. Test test test test. It doesn't show up visually. It doesn't show a character count as your typing. Okay. Yeah. One thing I was going to say while you're trying to hit that character limit is when blue sky first launched on mobile, one of the most positive things that we were saying about it was wow, this looks exactly like Twitter. And if meta can like make something that looks exactly like Twitter. Cool. I will say that like Elon made this one point that it's like worst person you know, just made a great point. You did. What is it? It doesn't show how many characters I typed. Does it feel like more than Twitter? That feels like about the same. I'd say about the same. It's probably two eight. Don't know for sure. Two 40. That's a reasonable amount. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, Elon made this point where he was like, can't wait for the future when the every single social media app on the internet is owned by one company. And it's like, yeah, I mean, that's part of the reason I loved Twitter was that wasn't part of some mega corporation. But he also wants to turn Twitter into that. Yeah. He's burning it down. He wants it to be a mega corporation. And also it's like now it's bundled in with like Tesla and SpaceX. I guess that is a potential concern is that for like leaving Twitter because we want to get away from one like, oh, we don't like what Elon's doing now. You're running into the arms of stuff. Is that what's happening? The billionaires own our souls basically. Which threads isn't going to be launching in the EU because of that. Wait, really, yeah, at all because they don't meet the data privacy requirements in the EU. They're still working it out. Yes, it's not going to be coming out at launch. They're going to work on it. They're working on it to get to follow anyone in the EU. You probably do. Also, quick question. I'm wondering how do you think this is going to tie into Instagram? So that is my guess. That's a big question for me. For sure. So like stories, reels, those are baked into the Instagram app. And those are the things that I think of as successful Instagram taking things. Yeah. So I was like IGTV. Yeah. I did give you that. So that one. Yeah. I was told that you will be able to share threads to stories. And it'll link directly to the threads app, which is interesting. And so that's how I think at launch, a lot of people will be sharing their threads accounts is by sharing a thread into your Instagram and getting that audience over there. That actually does make a lot of sense because how many people screenshot tweets and post it as a story. Yeah. So if you could just directly share an actual link to a tweet, you have a better way of giving credit to the people and actually giving them because of it. Jump straight to that. Exactly. You get to, it's probably because it's your own post. There's probably some sort of verified something happening there just to make sure you can like actually link it. Yeah. Because of that, I could see this being Twitter, in general, out of all the social medias, if you were to make a sponsored post as a creator, is the worst, like, the worst deals you'll get. Like because engagement on Twitter is lower, it has less people, and in general, like it's swiped through pretty quickly. Instagram's higher. And being able to to link directly to Instagram, I could see marketing companies wanting to use threads more with creators than Twitter. If it actually gets to that point of being as big as Twitter. Also, if a lot of people feel like they're seeing double because they've heard this thread's name before, there was an app called Threads from Meta. It was a dedicated, it only closed down last year in 2021. But it was a dedicated Instagram DM app that it was like it used your Instagram account just for DMs. And I don't know why they had it. I think they were like kind of testing whether or not people, because a lot of people, a lot of younger people use like Snapchat as the main way they communicate. And I actually talk to a lot of people only really through Instagram DMs, because it's a pretty fully fledged messaging app. So they tested an app called Threads, which was just messaging. They shut it down two years ago. And now they're just resurfacing the branding. The funny thing is the word Threads makes a lot of sense because it's already called a Twitter thread. And so if you could just like threads for conversations, it's pretty good. It's a pretty good name. I think about the logo. It's like the at sign with an additional little loop, right? Yeah, it's pretty simple. Yeah. Black, white on black. Yeah. I don't hate it. It looks too much like a generic at to me. But and also the color of it is a lot like Instagram, right? I think it's just when you are the splash screen as Instagram colors, but everything else seems to be black and white. I'm interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know what's fine? And I just found something and I'm not sure it's going to do this. But there's a corner up at the top. There's an Instagram logo. When I hit that, it goes to my Instagram profile. I wonder if there's a thread's logo. That would be amazing. That's it. It goes back to my threads. That would be great. That seems like what they would do. That's like a very seamless transition as well. Yeah. That was really nice. I really liked that. It's funny because I've definitely built. I've built a lot of my following on Twitter. And now I'm like, I wish they were on Instagram. And I have like a very much smaller percentage on Instagram. But I would like more people to be on my Instagram because I actually put my photos there. So if I can have the cross compatibility. No, I totally agree. And to add on to that, like I've enjoyed using Instagram more, but you take a bunch of great pictures. I don't I just make like one mind jokes on Twitter every once in a while. So like I would like to go over there so they can go together. Yeah, I'll just take all right it on the screen. And take a picture of it. Oh, yeah. I posted on my store. Yeah. Obviously that would be a great profile. It doesn't all in brown do that. Oh, really? See does something like that. Everyone has some some version of how they post things. It's been done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, by the time you guys listen to or see this podcast, it will be out. So all of us. All of us was useless because they already have it. Yeah, they're all. They want to know. They thread at us on how you like it. I was going to ask that. So a tweet a Twitter post is called a tweet is a thread post just called a thread. It shouldn't be because a thread is still a function within the app. So I feel like they should call it. It's probably just going to be called a post. Yeah. And if you make a post and nobody replies, they're on no thread. So it can't be a thread. Exactly. You could thread a thread and have a like thread squared. You have to reply to yourself to make it a thread. Yeah. Yeah. As long as you don't use the thread emoji, how long do we have third-party thread apps? Never, never. I feel like the era of third-party apps is just over. Isn't thread also like the hometown tech thread is part of matter. It's part of matter. Yeah. Thread is part of matter. Keep those straight in my head. Yeah. Well, yeah. Thread is out. If you want to follow us on thread, yeah. We're going to be we're that we will be the same handles that we are on Instagram. Yeah. So follow us on Instagram and then follow us on. I was also going to ask pop quiz to you guys. I don't know if how much you keep track of this, but if you have to sort by a number of followers on social networks, how do you think we MKBHD channels rank YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, throw on Google+. You're so yours. Oh, YouTube number one. Yes. Instagram number two. Twitter two. No, Twitter two. Twitter two. T two. Six mil. Then four point something mill on Instagram. Yeah. 17 mill on YouTube. And you saw four points on Instagram. Yeah. Wow. There's more Twitter. Like, where do you go? Google+. Top out. 100 million. I'm guessing like two. Two million. Google+. Top that a little over five million. Five million. Wow. Those were big. Those are bots. We were I was one of just suggested follows when you follow. Oh, yeah. So it was. Oh, so Google was more than Instagram. At the time, it was the highest thing that was not YouTube for me. Wow. Yeah. That's wild. What's your T two? Think about 500. That makes you top one. That's more than actually on the site. Yeah. That's actually everyone on the site. Wow. Well, bird. All right. I think that's good to know. I'm not on Macedon. So if you guys are thinking you're following me on Macedon, it's not me. Here's another thing with. So threads at launch will not support it, but it will be supporting it. It will support activity pub. So you can post on Macedon and see on threads post on threads. See it on Macedon. So we will have third pretty third pretty thread apps. Yeah. If you use Macedon. Yeah. Technically. Yeah. I it's not available at launch, but they're going to make it available, which is interesting. I think that yeah, that is interesting. I think that it's a PR play because it doesn't. People still want to use like the official main app and Macedon still way too confusing for most people. So I think Zach is like, oh, it shows that we're not trying to own everything in that like, you know, you could technically use whatever you want. But like most people are still going to use the official app. So it's really good. The app first and then go. Yeah. It's a really good PR play to make them like look like they're supporting the open web. And also the first party app has to be the most important. It's like for like regular people. And this is going to link from Instagram as I'm imagining. Like it was going to be a button from Instagram to threads. Yeah. We'll just find it organically through that. That would be great. I would love that. That's going to be a thing that drives the most discovery. Yeah. Or they could have just turned to Instagram and to Twitter. Well, they had that weird feature, the broadcast feature. They still have that. And they still have it. And I think that was the beginning of this. Have you gotten these? Yeah. Or they like send out a message. Yeah. That's weird. That just feels like a spam call. Yeah. Yeah. So I sent you a photo. And I'm like, what? And it's just a mass message to all their followers. I think that I had that happen on my phone while I was showing my phone to someone. And they were like, what? Yeah. Yeah. Socks. Just like a photo. Yeah. It sounds like a mall. It's been I had to explain. Yeah. We fight in cage matches like twice a week. Yeah. We've been sparring. Anyway. Okay. That's it for this week. This week on Waveform, of course. We will probably talk more about these social media things as they grow and expand and evolve. So let us know in the comments what you guys think, what you want us to talk about and follow us on all those things. And follow us on all those things. We will now attempt to answer the questions that Adam asked at the beginning. It's trivia time. Attempt to try. I am not going to get these right. I really thought I knew what the second one was, but I don't know any more. I have a million. I have an idea. I definitely don't have the first one. First question. What was the first commercially available smartphone with wireless charging? God, that is tough. I have. I'm so between two of them that if it's the wrong one, I'll be so mad. But if it's neither of them, then I won't be that. Yeah, that's exactly what you know. I'm changing what I originally put. Just cross it out. Don't erase. I know the first commercial phone with two gigabytes of RAM. I guess probably think that you see they just announced a phone with 24 gigs of RAM. Yeah. Really? I don't know what it was. It's a separate match. Some parts of gaming phone. Well, I burn up my time. I don't know the answers. Oh, wow. Oh, that might be right. I said the Nexus 4. It's not right. It's not right. I said the S2. Wrong. Who's closer? None of you actually. Well, I guess technically Andrew's kind of close, because I think the Galaxy 6 was the first Samsung Galaxy phone. That's what I did with the 6 Edge, something like that. Really? But the first one with wireless charging was actually the ASUS and phone 2. No. Okay, good. The Nokia 920 according to computer world. It came out in 2012. Wait, that's a Windows phone. It's not a smartphone. That's a smartphone. That's still a smartphone. Yeah. I don't know. What was it? The Nokia 920. Oh, oh, yeah. The, yeah. Was that the one made by HTC? There's a black polycarbonate. It is a thick phone. Yeah, it's a thick boy. It's the dumbest phone. Oh, I did a video on how I remember that. I did the 920 and the 1020 and I like that camera. I like how they have that camera and then they have the one with the Chonker 40 megapixel camera. That was the 1020. That's the first computer world. Okay, but what was the first Android phone with wireless charging? I don't know. 2012. I should be asking you that. Oh, the back of this 920. It's just like, well, a red square. And then just like, this is a little tiny camera with a thing that says, Nokia, it's taking up like 5% of the old tiny camera. Horrible looking. All right, next question while David Google's what the first Android phone was with wireless charging. In 2022, the blind smartphone camera test, the Pixel 6A one first place. What phone came in third? Overall, an elo rating. This is our own smartphone camera test. Yeah, I didn't look at the data as much as Andrew did. Andrew lived in this data for like three weeks. Yeah. He just slept under his desk. Maybe I'll blurred together for him. It's definitely. That's kind of what I'm hoping for. All right, flipping and read. I put Zenfone 9. All right. I'm so mad. I didn't get it. I assumed this was a trick question because we talked about the Zenfone. Wait, I need this moment. I need this moment. I also put Zenfone 9. Let's go. I also wrote the order of top four. I don't know if I'm all 20 clothes. Wait, I'm still in this. 20. Exactly. That's what I'm at too. Wait, Andrew, what did you put? I put the ROG. I almost put the ROG. I was like, but it's talking about Zenfone being good. And then I thought he was going to be like, oh, they're going to put the Zenfone. And I was like, well, I know the Zenfone did you guys want to bonus point? Yes. No. Bonus point. What was in fourth place? He wrote that down. It's hard. I wrote it. What would you put? S22 Ultra. Wrong. It was the Oppo 5 index 5. Oh, I'm mad. I should have put 5 index as my guess for third time. That's a care member. All right. So new scores. David 24. Andrew and Marquez tied naked naked 20. Which is a great set of scores together because next episode is the trivia extravaganza. Yes. So you don't say. My question is, does the fact that my head does not matter now because it's a very extravaganza? No, it does. Oh, no. It's like going from jeopardy to double jeopardy. You technically have an advantage, but it's not that. Wow. Bummer. Everyone that's fallen up until now, please congratulate me because I'm going to lose. You won the regular season. Now you got to bring it in the play. Yeah. Exactly. I'll see about that first run. I always crash. Either way, that's been it for this week on Waveform. Thanks for listening. Thanks for watching. Catch you next week in our trivia extravaganza. Well, we'll set up this one for all. Who is really truly the most trivia, technological on this podcast? Wow. That was really good. Have you said that before? No. Did you just come up with that? Just off the dome. Yeah. Nice. Oh, poet. Thanks for watching. See you later. Bye. Waveform was produced by Adam Alina and Ellis Riven.

We're your hosts. I'm Arches. I'm Andrew. And David, as you can tell, is currently not here. He's out. He's, I think he's taken some pictures in the Pacific Northwest somewhere. So we'll see him when he gets back. Yeah, follow him on Instagram because he's posting a lot of them and they're pretty sick so far. Some previews of those. But in today's episode, we have a little bit of Twitter versus threads. Around two, I've got some thoughts. Is it round two? We've definitely talked about them like specifically once. Yeah, it feels like it's sort of a second wave of Twitter versus stuff, I think so. Yeah. But we also have a little bit of a hype or not game to play at the end. So it's not a full game show episode, but we still have games. We've done it before and I think people liked it. It's a lot of fun to just like speculate about things that are maybe too hyped or not hyped enough. Yeah, I like playing hype versus not hype games. Yeah. But first we did both, we traveled or we did. You did something pretty cool. I had a trip. Right. So you want to, it's called the open. Right. Open the open and the couple days before the open was something called the open invitation. Okay. First time they've ever done it. So some of you guys may or may not know this, but I'm a golfer. I've been a golfer for, and I actually someone asked me this. I've heard this part, yeah. I've been a golfer for 20 years. Isn't it wilds that we are at a point in our life that you can say you've done something? I've been snowboarding for like 23 years at this point and I thought about that like, whoa, that's weird to say. It's weird. But yeah, I've been golfing for 20 years. I'm not as good as you would think as someone old. When you say, when you say I allowed that you've been doing something for 20 years, you think you're really good at it. I'm not. I've been playing on and off and obviously we have other stuff that we do. My first love, my first sport. So it was super cool to be able to play on the golf course that is in championship condition because the open, the major is being played there, basically as we speak. And it was actually sort of a practice round day. So a lot of the pros showed up by Walk Through Security right in front of Phil Michelson, put it on the putting green with him. And it was like a new event to sort of hype it up a little bit. So it was sort of a team's format and a bunch of invited sort of celebrity guest people and we played a scramble and we played the whole course and it was amazing. That's true. That was awesome. You guys won too, right? And we won the scramble. That's awesome. Yeah. I'll tell you what, there's nothing like first T-Gitters when there's first T-Gitters in any sport where you first drive and hit your first shot or hit the court for the first time, take your first shot. But when you're not used to playing in front of a crowd, the amplifier of people watching you, you don't get to appreciate on TV how many people there are and how close they are to you. You can hear people motor things under their breath. It's that close to you. And they've been watching making this shot. They've been watching professionals the whole day, like getting amazing shots and then we walk up and we're like, sorry, this is going to be a little worse than that. But no, it was sick. That's true. It came on the tail end of a ADL double header in Colorado and Salt Lake that we also won both games. That's awesome. And you can watch that. It was live streamed, right? I skimmed through and tried to watch all of your shots and I don't know golf, but they looked pretty solid. The announcers liked it. Yeah, yeah. I played okay. Obviously we won. We had a great team. Shout out to Catherine. She was the best player of the entire group and she was an under shot. Yeah, she had a six shot. She hold out for eagle on the last hole in front of the whole crowd. It was unreal. So yeah, go watch that. It'll be on YouTube. We'll put that link in the show notes if you want to check it out. You also went on your cancel. I didn't get you exactly the way to get there. You rescheduled it. I went to Grand Teton National Park in Yellowstone National Park and it was like beautiful tons of animals. I posted some photos, some really crazy wildlife photos. I never thought I'd be able to get in my life because I rented an awesome one. Yeah, I have a couple of grizzly bear shots, which is pretty cool. I'm actually making a video for the studio channel right now. Kind of about some of the tech that I like to bring because I talk about hiking way too much on the podcast. So I figured let's get it all in one video so I can maybe shut up about it for like a few months and then we'll get all the gear, all the nerding out of all the stuff. Exactly. Yeah, so that'll be up there soon. But we also just posted another video on the studio channel that was like a total banger from Ellis, his first solo hosted video. Do you want to tell us a little bit about it? No. Okay, sit. Go watch it. Definitely go watch it. It's really good. It's really funny and really insightful. I like learning experience. Yeah. But the week I was supposed to be on vacation, I missed a little bet that you guys had and Adam just posted it on shorts and I wanted to kind of get in on this because I just get in on the cyber truck. On the cyber truck bet. Okay. So I think the bet was 25 non-employees received delivery by the end of 2023. Yeah, well, it actually happened. I say yes. Everyone else said no. I'm going to agree with you on this one. Actually, which thank you. It's come on. Hit the buzzer. I know you're looking for it. It's fine. Man, I'm telling you. So yes, I agree with you. I still think it'll be under 100. I think it's going to be a very small amount. I don't think it's going to be a lot. So we're all excited about it and everyone on Twitter is like, oh my god, it's coming. Brother, it's kind of announced in 2019. Like, oh, no. No, no, no, no, I know you're not. I just need to say it. We're excited. But like, man, this thing was out there and I was just thinking how many other EV pickup trucks have come out since that, since they got announced and just like the lead they thought they were going to have in the pickup space world and how much they blew that lead away. It's been really interesting. I don't know how much I thought it would matter that they were first to be an EV pickup truck. Like, yes, Rivian came out before them and that was their thing. Was they were the first EV pickup truck, basically, ship. And I don't know how much it helps to be the first one if it's $100,000. And then the F-150 Lightning comes out and I am seeing a lot of them on the road and it's an F-150, so it should be popular. But the Cybertruck also has, I don't know, how many, I'll Google it. How many million pre-orders are there for the Cybertruck? I mean, a $100 refundable. Also, the order is like a weird, which for Tesla is a great little four-year interest-free loan they got. But yeah, I do think it, I kind of think it is pretty important, especially if you're not accompanying known for doing pickup trucks. So I think the fact that Rivian got in there first, probably helped Rivian quite a bit to be able to say first EV pickup is, and then when Ford comes out, you know people who are Ford loyal are going to go for it. Yeah, they had a ton of people in mind. We were talking to Ford about this. They had tons of people pre-ordering F-150 Lightning and for many of them it was their first truck and for many of them it was their first Ford. And so, you know, just like getting an EV just changes the equation for a lot of people. So yeah, I think Cybertruck, it's still going to come out in this sort of new-ish age of EVs. And I think it's going to have an impact. It kind of reminds me of a hot take that I'm going to talk about in a hot take video, which I kind of want to spoil a little bit, because I think it's one of the funniest ones. Just try to do it, send it. Okay, one of the hot takes that I'm going to address in the video with a little more precision than this is someone said the Cybertruck is going to outsell the F-150 by 2026. Can I confirm the F-150 or the F-150 Lightning? The F-150. I did the same thing. That person is optimistic, I would say. That person is, I don't even know a nice way to say it. That's one of the dumbest takes I've ever heard. So you can buy what's your self-worth when? 2026. So three years. Zero shots. Okay, but think of it this way. If you're a Tesla fan and you see, this is the, I'm going the the most optimistic route. Okay, there's a million and a half pre-orders of the Cybertruck right now. Let's say they start shipping at the end of this year and they make them all in the first two years. And by the time they start making them the third year, they have another million people order. So by 2026, they shipped all the pre-orders and they're going to make another million new orders. That would put it on pace to match the F-150. Now the chances that they actually ramp up production that fast and sell all the ones and nobody cancels and they sell all the ones they made and make another million orders very, very low. But the F-150 sells like 600 to 900,000 every single year and it's the most successful vehicle in America. So if you're saying it's going to overtake the most successful vehicle for the past 40 years running in three years, you're an optimist and it's probably a hot take and I like that it's hot but it's probably not going to happen. Just put it at that. Yeah, I just don't think there's any shot that that happens. I mean, it's four years of pre-orders, right? And even that is barely what Ford actually sells. Honestly, I think the most of the pre-orders happened in the first year. I do think so also, but that's why I don't see that pre-orders getting finished and X amount more coming in. You hit a very huge part of the ones that you think you're going to sell, those aren't all going to sell and then you're not going to get a higher influx once it actually comes out. Especially with now R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, I'll say that the Hummer pickup truck, but I don't think that's much. And the Silverado is already getting test driven by journalists now. So there's quite a few. I think that comes out probably around the same time and there's other options at this point. Don't forget the Lord's Town. Yeah. So I'm actually good to see you. If you're not watching my video version, I'm sorry for that. I don't actually mean that. There's a, but we were talking this morning because I wanted to say it's interesting how many pickup EVs got announced and delivered since the Cybertruck got announced. And I thought the Rivian was announced after, but it was actually a year before the Cybertruck, which I didn't realize. And I think that just kind of goes to prove that when you're an EV company, no one knows about and you announce a truck, no one takes it seriously because to me, until the Rivian started like showing up, I didn't really take them seriously. So this Lord's Town stuff, like no part of me considers this a thing that I'm going to ever see until I start actually seeing that's totally fair. I think the difference is with Rivian, it was their first ever vehicle. And so it's hard to take anything they do seriously until they start shipping their first ever vehicle. And that's true about for a future. And that's true about Lord's Town. And that's true about so many others. But why I think it's different with Tesla is this not their first rodeo, which is why when I see them starting to test meals and roll around camo versions of it, it seems like they're actually ramping up to something real where the others I could never prove that. Yeah, I agree. I think you clarified what I meant there is more like these new EV companies as they're just first EV in general. Like, Tesla's been around for longer, but it's also been four years. So maybe I shouldn't have given them as much trust as I thought I did. And it's impossibly hard to make an EV truck and we're all learning. But it's a simple stamp that so many fleets they can just stamp out a bunch of them. That's why the designs like that man. They'll just roll out like nothing in a legend for years. This thing is a 6,000 pound guillotine with electric motors. I will say, this is true. And I think it's weird because I keep hearing this about the Cybertruck, but like the Hummer EV and the Rivian are both over 7,000. I think the Hummer EV might be over 9,000. Yeah, and it's bigger than the Cybertruck. And it's admittedly it's not sharp on the corners. That's definitely a difference. And I don't know how that plays into these tests or whether it'll get pulled. Yeah, it also has crumple zones. The Cybertruck, they're really big on the fact that like, this thing won't crumple. It'll just go through despite having a front trunk. Whatever you hit, which is good for the occupant, but not whatever you hit. It's good for the occupant in theory, right? Assuming you just do go clean through. But remember that the whole point of a crumple zone is to slow down. It's to send energy around the vehicle, past the passenger compartment. So there is a very realistic chance that your truck will be perfectly fine. And you will be like a chef boy, R.D. Can in this area. The windows are bulletproof so you won't go through them. Don't worry. You can just splat up a guy. I feel like I should say before the Tesla boys come out too late. The model three and the model S are some of the safest cars money can buy. Biggest crumple zones in any vehicle. Yeah, the NHTSA says like those are at the top of the chart. So maybe they've got some tricks out there sleeve. But to me, this just seems like they should make this illegal to drive around schools, right? There's a like, there's no way any grade schooler could survive getting hit by a Tesla truck, which is so high off the ground, they couldn't see them anyway. I don't know how different it'll be than the Hummer EV. The thing, even just outside of EVs, the trucks and like SUVs were driving in America are so dangerous towards pedestrians every way. And we let them drive all the time. Like I just don't see anyone actually stopping the cyber truck as being any more dangerous as these. The amount of times I've almost been like clipped on the side of a sidewalk in town because some lifted pickup truck. I was just in Uber. Yeah. In the city and we're in like a Denali or a Yukon XL or something. And it's just like riding in it. I'm just like we are Kings of the road right now. Yeah, this is insane. They're so high and they have such a big front and like front grille and everything. It's hard to see over. And if you're in the blind spot of them, it's dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. It's terrifying. Let's put a blade on it. Yeah, let's make it go zero to 60 in three seconds. And drive it. This is why the Hummer was hilarious when it came out. It was like the Hummer just 9,000 pound massive refrigerator of a vehicle can also do a zero to 60 in three seconds. How does that make any sense? I think the only reason I'm more scared of the cyber truck is just I know there'll be more of them on the road. Whereas the Hummer EV just like I think it's a pretty niche vehicle. So I'm not as but like if I saw Hummer EV on the highway, I probably would just pull over, take a break and just like wait for that thing to be far away from where I am. That's fair. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see if the deliveries happen and and then if they reverse the deliveries, we'll have to come back to that bet. But I stand it's not I don't think it's coming out this year. It's really dumb. All right. Well, I think that's a good spot to take a quick break. We got a lot to talk about with threads and Twitter. But of course before we do breaks, it's time for trivia. Start of the season. All fresh. What number season is it? Three. Is it this season? Three. Okay. You won season two. You also won season one. So six. Okay. First question coming from Ellis. All right. So I was reading on the internet as one does. And I found out that you can wake up a computer from sleep using just the internet. You don't even have to be at the same room. In order to do that, you send a very particular message to the target computer to wake it up. It's a very silly name. That's why it's trivia question. What is the name of that message? This is multiple choice or yeah. Am I need multiple chase for this one? You know what? I'll make up some choices. I was going to say I mostly want it because I want to hear your made up versions of your you know what? I'll just off the dome right now. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Number one, a stop STOMP. These are all acronyms. Number two, Womp WOMP. Number three, Klomp. At number four, alarm, wild card. All right. I'm impressed by the off the dome. I have a feeling that some of them rhyme. Yeah. And that helps a little bit. I'll be brainstorming on that through the break. Answers are at the end as usual. We'll be right back. All right. We're back. So we've been using Twitter for years. Yes. And we've been using Meta's threads for about two weeks now. Two weeks. Do you call it meta all the time? I still call Facebook. I do have to remember to call it meta. Okay. And sometimes I don't. I just say Facebook. But it does say like when you have the splash green meta. So you know, I get reminded of it. Yeah. We have a lot of thoughts. I've been using them both. I'm interested. You know, various intents in and I think you kind of see the waves now of things happening with each of them. Yeah. I don't want to we were saying it's like the second wave, but it almost feels like the fourth wave. Like the first wave was the date launched, which was in the midst of a trough with Twitter, because they had like the rate limit scandal and all this is happening. And then threads launches and explodes. Right. And there's tons of people joining tons of engagement. You could consider that the first wave. Okay. Even though there was like the zero wave of like all the pre-release testers. Then I'll leave that out. Then the second wave was like, all right. It's sort of stabilized for like four or five days in 70 million, 100 million users. All right. We're here. What do we do now? And then Twitter on the other side is like a little bit quieter than usual. And you're kind of looking around Twitter like interesting. I feel like there's last posts happening, but also like a day off. Is it a holiday? Why isn't anyone on the road today? It's like a tumbleweed going across. And then the third wave was then suddenly like all of the here I am engagement farming posts happening on threads. And then all the like threads versus Twitter talk. And then I feel like the fourth wave is now Twitter flips a switch, turns on a monetization feature starts writing a bunch of checks. And like literally the other day there was a post from Adam Asari that they had to turn on rate limits because suddenly there's a bunch of spam happening. And they needed to actually slow that down. And so now it's sort of equalizing. And obviously the spike in engagement at the beginning is what you'd expect to see. But it's never going to hold to that level. But it is at a different place. So there's a lot to go over with where we see both of these platforms going. Yeah. And the last time we talked about it was by the time the episode came out that launch date had happened. But when we were talking about it, we were just basing it off of your like day before pre-release and talking there. So like we haven't really covered that whole step through process that you just mentioned all the waves. So do you want to like really quickly go over how you've been using threads and what you've thought about it so far? Sure. Yeah. So I mean, it launched and there's always just that like fun first couple days of something new where you just play around with it. So our poking around, you know, I think I I tagged just random people. I tagged Mark Cuban. I said, can I be a guest on Sharknank? And he was like, yeah, let me get back to you on that. I like the idea. I tagged Zach in a feature request. And he was like, yeah, but it's on the list. Like just kind of poking around and seeing what's happening and things are all moving and colorful and exciting. It's fun. That part is fun. Like everybody's just like, what do we do here? Yeah. And like it's the difference I think of that is what we've talked about a million times before is that the user base is so important on all of these. Like we all dealt with this on Blue Sky and T2 and mastodon. But now within, was it not 24 hours threads already had more than probably all three of those combined? Probably within hours. Yeah. Yeah. So like you get to actually experience this like, hey, this is kind of neat. Yeah. Everyone's nice. What do we do? It's like walking into a party and like so many people you know are there and you're like, whoa. Oh, you're here too. Oh, wow, you're all here. That's crazy. What are we talking about? What are we doing here? And you're so excited. You don't get into the like toxic hellscape argument of like the regular Twitter thread. And that was just nice for like a week. Yeah. I think then once you've gotten over the hump of like, right, we're all here. We're all trying to do stuff. Then it's like, what do we post here? And and this is from someone who posts on social media for a living. I'm like, do I post the same things that I'm posting in other places or do they not belong here? I saw at the beginning so many, you know, and so much emphasis from the founders about things like conversations and just text posts and it's it's called threads. It's literally just like text threads. People talking to each other. So I kind of assumed I'd mostly just be using it like Twitter in like text threads. Not a lot. I'm not in post in a YouTube link. So I wasn't thinking about posting any, you know, photos or videos, even though you still can technically. But then the question is like, well, I just posted some short form video on Instagram. Do I also post it on threads? Is that like double posting? I posted on Twitter. Maybe I posted on threads in Twitter, but not Instagram or Reels or shorts is I don't know. It's kind of just a weird. There's a thought process now to it. So that that's in the back of my head the whole time. But then also I do find it fun to engage with shorts because it does for me still feel like it has this second fastest engagement rate of any social network behind Instagram. Sorry, your threads are short. You said shorts. Threads, okay. Yeah, so like on Instagram, if I post something within 10 minutes, there's over a hundred comments. There's probably 10,000 likes and you can just see just chaos activity happening where that's very different on Twitter versus shorts. YouTube shorts has almost the opposite like a low two-day burn before it hits the shorts feed and then takes off. So shorts is just or threads is just interesting to just like poke around and reply to something and just see how fast you can talk to people on threads before the threads over. Yeah. And from that first week, like despite having wildly, like less people on the platform and less followers than like Twitter that I had, like the engagement I was getting felt kind of crazy. I think just everyone was so excited to be on it. They were on it a lot more. They were replying all over the place. There was engagement everywhere. Everyone was like, oh, shoot, I didn't realize you're on here yet. Like what's up? Did you follow the, did you follow everyone that you follow on Instagram or did you, did you follow separate people? It's funny because it's more along the lines of the people who I follow on Twitter because Instagram to me is still been this slow move over of more of my personal life versus this social media work life, I guess. And on threads, I found it really interesting because a lot of people that I do know in my personal life on Instagram that don't have Twitter were creating threads. And then you could see, yeah, just some of their stupid little, that's what I love about just like very short text-based posts is like you can just have one random thought and that thought can be hilarious. And it just makes my day. That's the most pure like early version of Twitter. It's incredible. I love it so much. That's like when you can open this sweet from your phone. Yeah. And you can do it. It was just like a hundred forty years. Like when you're sending a text message to it. Yeah, just a 140, just a blurb of a thought. Yeah, that's kind of how it starts. And I think now you're seeing like the people who are here to get engagement, you're going to figure out like how to turn this into a page. There's the LinkedIn bros showing up, like trying to optimize and like doing all these crazy things like you expect that with any new shows, even though it's not monetizable directly. Yeah, it's still you expect that. That was kind of the fun part of the beginning. It was like when that happened, people were like, no, get that off. No, this platform's fun right now. Get that grind set crap off of here. Like yeah, block that mute that. Yeah. But I think like like you said, one of the biggest issues of it off the beginning, or you didn't say it, but this is what you tweeted at I think Adam responded to you about just having an actual front page with the people you follow, not random people. And they did say they're working on it, which is great. I'm a little worried it's going to be, which is similar to Twitter now where that's not going to be your main. You're going to have to swipe into it as a secondary one. That is always fascinating to me because every social media has to have some balance of this where you follow people because you want to see what they post. But in order for them to be successful and keep you engaged, they need to be giving you new things. It's almost like on Spotify, like we have the music that we want to listen to. But there's also like if you hit shuffle, it's going to just toss in some music you've never heard before. It's going to toss in some explore weekly or whatever. And that's what TikTok has got. TikTok is probably the far end of the scale. You don't even really check who you follow. Most people don't check who they follow. It's just the for you page. And on the other side, maybe it's closer to like Twitch or YouTube. Back in the day, I only watched twice subscribe tube. And now it's mostly homepage. It's things that recommend YouTube getting closer to that that TikTok side where like I'm watching people that I realize I'm not subscribed to because I'm just so consistently getting fed their stuff that I enjoy. So Instagram now too, it used to just be like people you follow in the post that they make with the photos. Now it's just like tossing stuff in my feed. Obviously the explore page and reels is giving you new stuff. So now they're pushing towards that. So now threads shows up. And of course, we're following a bunch of people. We're engaging with a bunch of stuff. But yeah, the homepage is full of people you don't follow. And so as a purist, I want just the list of people that follow in the things that they post because that's why I'm here. I just joined threads to follow 12 people. But they don't even have a following count for people. They just show you the homepage and you can follow people on the homepage, but it's constantly pushing you new stuff. And that's just the way social is in 2023. And I guess it's cool that it's on their list, but I kind of doubt it's very high on their list. Yeah, or it's not going to be like a default. Because Instagram, you can do only following chronological, but it's not even like in Twitter where you just swipe over. It's like a drop-down menu, yeah, which then you have to do every time you open the app, I think, which is my suspicion is it will never be the default. I totally agree with that. Yeah. I did. Sorry. Quick question. When do you think they're going to add ads? Ads. Because I think a big part of why people like it right now is because there's no ads. It's very pure with no ads. I think meta has the bank role to be able to roll this for a little bit without ads. And I think that's probably the smartest decision to eventually don't add and make a ton of money on it. But they, I think we all can probably agree. They push this pretty quickly in a very opportune moment with what was going on with Twitter. So why not completely capitalize on Twitter, maybe, uh, stuff. I feel like they already like, I think they did. I think they did a lot of the thing that they're still definitely and don't mess a stuff mode, I think. Yeah, the pressure needs to just stay on. Yeah. Like I think Twitter can have a bad week and it's fine. But if you have a really good couple of months in a row on threads and it's the activity still going and like you didn't ruin it with ads yet, then you start to really think about like, all right, we're actually taking real meaningful market share. We're actually changing the landscape of social media. Then maybe you start thinking about, okay, we'll do a little bit of ads here and there. Yeah. And there's a, there's a benefit to being having multiple different social media sites and products that are making money and then one being able to lose some versus spending $44 billion immediately having the worth of that and then having to try and make up for all the loans that you take. Yeah, but Metta's also like burning money in VR and AR. So like they need something to give them money right now. They've got some others. They still have Facebook and Instagram. That's true. Yeah. Cash clienty of money. Okay. So the next question, how long until Google makes one Google everyone with a Gmail already gets an account. You just bring it over. I was this is why I was do you remember how many things Google plus did to read like Google plus was ahead of its time for real. Google plus, which I used for every year it was out as I've mentioned many times before. But like do you remember when there's a plus one plus one button on everything on Google search? There are still like I'll still see some trucks with advertisements on them that will still show their social media links and they'll be like a Google first. I don't know why. Yep. On YouTube, they forced everyone to turn their profile into a Google plus account. So you could only like you could plus one comments plus one videos, share it to your circles. They forced all of that like the same way that we got this like nice plug with Instagram for threads to take off. They did that with Google search and YouTube. So the fact that that doesn't exist anymore is a pretty good indicator that you can't really brute force your way into it. It's got to be good. But like Google, Google tried Google did try. So yeah, but they tried like 14 years ago. They gave it a good old Google try like whoa, this didn't work immediately. Cut it. I totally remember when they did that and like being however old I was like a child and like watching the Philip DeFranco video where he's like going over like yeah, they're making everyone sign up from Google plus and I remember just childhood me being like this is an outrage. Yeah. Yeah. As if it like affected me at all. That's amazing. It was it was a it was a it seemed like a turning point on the internet because Google had that kind of power where like if you got a lot of plus ones on your site that would specifically improve your search ranking. And that's already an incentive to be strong on Google plus. That was the gamification of that would be out of this world more than SEO right now. Like they should just go back to that and that'll be again the way that you write that platform will be destroyed by bots and like people just turning it into a total mess by gamifying everything. I mean, Google never said specifically what how much of a percentage the Google plus thing had to your ranking. But it became very clear that like you wanted to be strong on Google plus you want to be the most plus one thing on your search page to get you to the top. You were the second most plus one thing. Where it's you? Maybe. I don't know. I was one of the I was one of the accounts that they suggested you follow when you joined. That's awesome. So that was pretty solid for that's a badger bomber. Yeah, that was pretty cool. So yeah, I don't know. I do think the the Instagram poll is very strong, but I don't think the growth phase is over yet. I still think they have to they're still in don't mess this up mode. And as people poke around and find what to do, they can add the features that people seem to want the most. Yeah, they're definitely in like a slight you know, they they had their high of like everybody joining right away. And now it's going to dip a little bit and exactly what you said. Don't screw this up so that dip doesn't go too far down and that dip it steadies off. And then I found one thing that I think threads can do that Twitter and Instagram can't do except when I tried to do it, it didn't work. So let me explain it. I was at the airport. And I think the reason this didn't work is just because of poor airport Wi-Fi. That's why it didn't post. But if you think about it, threads is the only place that you can post more than four images that don't all get automatically cropped to square because once you had more than two photos on Instagram and a gallery, it auto-crops it into a square. And you can only do four photos on Twitter. So I took all these different pictures and different aspect ratios and portrait and landscape. I was cropping them. And I wanted to post all the photos that took on my trip. And I could do that on threads, except that it just kept failing to post in the airport Wi-Fi. And it didn't actually go through. So I just wound up cropping them on Instagram. Some things like that feel like features when I think really they're just not yet pruned. Like they're going to definitely limit that. You think they're going to limit that? Yeah. They're kind of the same. It's meta. Like they're going to probably find a way to compress more efficiently. And they're going to find ways to reduce the amount of bandwidth you need to use to post. And maybe if everyone's, you saw David was posting, he was had these huge panoramas and landscape that would take up your entire phone. I wish he was here so we could talk about this because I feel like that is something he would enjoy. David is definitely not taking 10 square pictures at once and wants to post more than four out of time. So I'm sure that would, if it works, work well for him. He's giving you that iMacs experience on threads, you know. It's longer than your phone. You can only view it on a Sony Xperia phone. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Before we get into Twitter and what they were doing, Twitter had to have been, if we step back to Wave 1 here, there's just something a little peculiar about if you posted any threads links on Twitter that I think is pretty obvious and just very funny, but it was clearly suppressing. Right. I think I have a picture here of your timeline. You posted something that just says, it's actually impressive how bad Siri is. 8.4 million impressions on Twitter. Next post. For some threads and the link to your threads link, 200,000 impressions. And then another video of a caviar iPhone 1.1 million impressions. Yeah. Some of this is a little fishy there. Interesting. Yeah. I don't think it would be a shock to anyone if they uncovered just the word threads or any threads that you are. Yeah. They're definitely not showing that to people the way to show other things to people. Not shocked by that. I don't honestly, this is like a part of social also where I think when you post a lot of social media and you're trying to optimize all your content, you're like, what do these platforms incentivize and how can I ride those waves on Twitter or on any website? Like on YouTube, they do not like you sending people to external websites, period. So on YouTube, if you have a really popular link at the top of your description and that link is sending people somewhere, like I remember we used to do giveaway videos. And a lot of people would use like a giveaway hosting service or whatever. Like some thing. And there will be a link at the top. And those videos would always bomb. Really? Because you're sending people off the site and YouTube is going, whoa, whoa, we don't like this video. This video is sending people off of YouTube. And so you do this massive giveaway, but it would get like a 10th and normal traffic. Do you know another good example of that is? Doesn't shorts have a thing that sees if the TikTok logo isn't it because they don't want you to just take your exact TikTok video that also shows a link to how you follow them on TikTok? I'm not sure if they've admitted this yet, but a lot of them definitely. I think that was like a pretty obvious. Yeah, I'm not sure if it was shorts or reels. I think it's a real, it's a TikTok logo. I think that's the one everyone knows about. But I'm also pretty sure like if YouTube sees a TikTok logo, they don't want to push that either. Yeah. Yeah. That's a fact. It's already funny. It's also very funny that threads has an immediate share to Twitter button, which is just like I'm sharing essentially my tweet on a different bro to Twitter. But yeah. But let's talk about Twitter. Yeah. Twitter, Twitter, want through some stuff. Twitter had that like sort of a quiet couple days. You know what it felt like? It felt like New York City after the hurricane. After hurricane. It was like two days and it was like, it's kind of quiet. Which is kind of cool. It's yeah. It's kind of like, you don't usually see it like that. Post apocalyptic Twitter. Yeah. There was some graph of a, I think it was a cloud flare thing. It's trying to show that like Twitter traffic did actually tank for a little bit. I don't even know how accurate that would represent everyone's Twitter experience. But if you use Twitter every day, you probably noticed there was less stuff happening. It came back. Lots of random things keep happening at Twitter. And then one big thing that happened is they started doing payouts for verified users who are in like a revenue sharing program. Yeah. It's essentially if you now get a portion of the revenue that is created through the ads that are only posted inside your replies. So I'm sure we've all noticed that replies on Twitter have ads now. Very annoying. But I get it. Yeah. So those specific ads will now benefit the creator that it gets posted under. Yeah. I tweeted to my subscribers on Twitter. So if you are a subscriber on my Twitter, you saw this a week or two ago. But I got a screenshot because I just like got a pop up when I open Twitter one day. It says congrats at mkbhd. As your share of ads revenue and replies, you're receiving $6698. Your portion will be deposited into your Stripe connected account within the next 72 hours. Thanks for being creator on Twitter. And you just hit okay. And that's it. There's no analytics. There's no. Oh, this isn't the last 30 days. This is there's no like here's the tweet that generated you the most or like any information. This is the only information I've gotten about this. And I can go into my analytics and try to find more. I can go into my Stripe account and try to find more almost nothing. But interesting. But everyone got this screenshot of like, oh, I'm going to get paid for my tweets, I guess. Yeah. So let's take I had some questions. It sounds like yeah, you can't really answer them. So my favorite thing to do on waveform. Let's speculate. Sure. There's a bunch of people and some people are getting paid a lot of money. I mean, I saw multiples over $10,000. Yeah. But one interesting thing here is my two main questions are one. It says that this is retroactive back to February, February when it was announced. Interesting. So if you think about that, then this isn't just like 30 days worth like six months. This is like six months worth that makes a lot of which is a lot which under why a lot of these are very big. Do you have a separate payment for subscriptions? Yes. It is separate. So that is not included in this. This is different. And it's also through Stripe. But that this amount, this new thing that popped up was separate from subscriptions. Subscriptions has already been happening. It has a payout in a totally different way. It's the same way. But it's this is just it's not a lump sum. Okay, cool. So that does actually help that because I was wondering like, man, some of these numbers I'm seeing are crazy. Yeah. Do you want to go? I saw Jimmy, Jim, Mr. Beast posted one. I think you did the same thing. He posted first subscribers. So sorry, Jimmy. But yeah, it was the same thing. It was like $25,000. I think I saw his, so I don't think it's a subscribe. Yeah. So it's just out there. Yeah. So that's like six months worth of. So you're you're looking at maybe a thousand a month. Basically, yeah. So you do the math six months, six thousand. Yeah. I mean, not much to just share your random tech thoughts. Yeah. Everyone's a little. To deal with the annoyance of ads showing up under tweets all the time. That seems like basically, I think that moment on Twitter where it was like, oh, if I am a part of this program, I am incentivized to post more and use Twitter more because I will be paid more accordingly. And anytime that moment happens on a social media platform, that changes the landscape of it forever. Like every time that's ever happened. Yeah. Now to different extents, like when that happened with TikTok, it was a creator fund. And people didn't really make that much money. So it didn't change it that much. But when YouTube got the partner program and started revenue sharing, that inflection point changed YouTube forever. Yeah. So Twitter finally getting this moment. And we don't have any details about like what are our PMs? What are, is it a shrinking pile of money? Is it a percentage? Like what is it happening? We don't really know. But the fact that it happened at all was enough for people to sort of come back to Twitter and start talking about it and figuring it out. Yeah. And there's some cool parts of it. You do have to be subscribed to Twitter blue. But I actually don't think that's that big of a deal. If it's $8 a month, then you're probably going to make, if you're somebody making obviously over $8 a month, it pays for itself. That's kind of nice. The one question I saw people have was it says you need five million impressions over the last three months. And two things here, one, do you have to keep that streak? Do you always have to have three straight months of five million in order to do that? And then I also included this tweet on here, which we'll show on the screen. And I'll read out loud. But someone named John Kraus. So I think we've talked to him for the podcast before. He takes photos of like SpaceX and like rocket launches. His impressions are hilarious when you look at them versus having to have a three-month streak of five million because he goes January 6.7 million, February 5.3 million, March 4 million, then April 74 million, May 9 million or June 4.9 million. So wouldn't hit it there. And then July 101 million. So if that's what it was, he's well averaging over 5 million. But he doesn't have the streak of 30. But potentially doesn't have the streak. I mean, this is a very niche amount of people that this would happen to, but that would be super unfortunate to pull 101 million impression month. I think it should be, I guess if I was going just by the YouTube model, you just have to get the streak once and then you're in the program. Yeah. It would be hard to imagine getting 70 million impressions in a month and just not being in the program like pretty quickly. But you know, it's hard to tell. We don't know. My other worry and I saw this a lot of people saying this is just does this potentially incentivize people to steal more content on Twitter and post themselves versus retweeting or linking to original sources. Like, why would you link to a YouTube video that might not get as many clips when you can clip the YouTube video and upload it yourself? It's obviously going to have to go through a bunch of copyright things now, which I think it already is apparent on Twitter, just not as enforced as YouTube. Now you're potentially making money like, what would you like, am I wrong on that? No, no, I was just like, that's a really soft, there's whole movies. There's like, like the Super Mario movie was in theaters and on Twitter at the same time. Yeah. This is reminding me of like the kick website. They're just like, yeah, man, come over here, stream whatever you want. We're streaming the Super Bowl. I'm like, you guys know that's not going to work for very long, right? They're already starting to now strike all these big people that went over there and are like, I thought we could watch movies. It's like, no, it's not the Wild West. It's the internet still. There's still copyright laws. That's exactly right. So this is why it feels like Twitter, and I've been telling people that Twitter whenever I have any contact with Twitter to like, please communicate more. Like, people need to know what the rules are. And at this point, we don't know most of these rules. Like, on YouTube, for example, we know about the copyright system. We know about how to get into the partner program, what the requirements are. And then once you're in how it works, you get all the analytics and the revenue sharing information so you can optimize whoever you want based on known info on Twitter. None of that is really communicated at all. So these are people to communicate. Yeah. So communication team turns out. But like, this would be super useful information for this whole inflection point to have the most impact. But as of right now, yeah, it feels like, yeah, there is going to be people who just go, oh, more Twitter activity equals more money. Okay, let's just post constantly and steal a bunch of stuff and post more because it doesn't seem to be rules that specifically enforce that. Where one you do define them, then you get better answers. Yeah. And I think like a pretty good example of even past like videos are pretty obvious, you're copyrighted or like audio. It's pretty obvious you're stealing that. But when it's just like a random thought, it's very hard to prove that you were the original of that. And there are people that can just scrape not only Twitter, but a ton of other stuff. We know there's somebody who we know got very popular on Twitter from just scraping Reddit threads about programming. And now is has a very big following and just basically retweets and repost things that are already on the internet already. And yeah, probably is making quite a bit of money from this. Yeah. And I don't know if there's any Twitter copyright system the way you see it built so clearly through YouTube. Like, that's that system that was built behind YouTube. Like took years and negotiation and lawyers and paperwork and like that is built now in a way that it's part of YouTube. I hit to keep using YouTube. But like, hey, it's the S tier platform. So they've got to build. It's figured out. So yeah, this is something they've got to figure out whoever's in that office building just got to figure it out. I was feeling they're just going to wing it till they can't anymore. Yeah, might as well. I'm sure there's also threads conversations probably about this because threads is so new. I don't think there's obviously there's no revenue share program. But when they do start doing revenue sharing or ads or whatever, they got to figure that out too. Yeah, we'll see. I'm interested to see. I am very interested with what Adam said is like when are ads going to start getting onto threads. I guess to wrap up this conversation, I kind of wanted to see how you think or like how is threads been turned into your just like everyday life right now? Because I think that's the most important thing. Yeah. Well, I guess I can it's probably different for everyone. We can probably all just for me personally. It's not on my primary home screen. Okay. It's on one of my home screens, though. Okay. It replaced his Twitter on your primary home screen. No. Okay. It's next to Twitter on my third home screen. Okay. Cool. So it's you know, it's made it out the app drawer, which is cool. And yeah, I open it just for like the same level of entertainment as Instagram. Interestingly, it's not the same content, but it's the same level of I'm just going to scroll for a while and see some fun stuff and piece out. I was in an airport for four hours and just like flipping back and forth. You know, it's just like casual passive entertainment. And once in a while you engage a little bit reply for some threads, talk to people. It's kind of what it is. There's no DMs. So yeah, that's just like surface level what I use it for. Yeah, I'd say my use case on it right now is like I still have that habit of just mines in a folder right next to Twitter, but my my like habit is to just folder Twitter like it's just like such a habit to just like yeah, so I'm so much more hitting Twitter scrolling through Twitter and then being like this isn't great. Oh yeah, there's threads and then going to threads and then looking at that and then maybe replying like once. And overall, my just like my usage of social media that's reliant on text posts has just dwindled quite a bit. There's a question. Yeah. Let's say you you have a bucket of all your social media. Let's say it's I don't know 100 units have your units overall gone up or have you split up your units into smaller pieces. Like if you did like 50 units of Twitter and 50 units of Instagram, are you now doing 50 more units of threads? Are you doing less Twitter or less Instagram to make room for threads? We're the I think I've probably just been using Instagram more overall because it's just like seeing photos and and being more following the people that I know in my like personal life has been I've just realized like man as much fun as it is sometimes it's just like there's so many people bickering and arguing and like it's just more fun to stay away from that a little bit on Twitter, but I mean like it's gonna it's gonna be a thread soon. It's probably already starting to come in there. My Twitter has been and it got cleaned up a little but so bot ridden and I know you guys have mentioned that like there's a lot of that on threads lately. I haven't seen it but I'm just not on threads as much. I would I would say like it goes Instagram, Twitter and then threads, but I'm probably engaging more on threads. But I'm reading Twitter more because I still think that's like a habitual thing that'll be very hard to break and that's and it's so like news based and there's so many like I like keeping up to date with news and that's because people I'm following when threads does that and when it becomes more like apparent and people are on there which will happen. Yeah, I'll see myself using threads more maybe I would like a dim mode on threads. Not the dark mode. I like dim mode on Twitter. Not full black. It is. David agrees with me on this. I know David agrees with me on this. I for some reason it's like blue purple almost. Yeah, like super dark navy or whatever. It's not white black. It's not quite full black. Interesting. Okay. I'm hoping for a little trending topics page on threads. Yeah. That would be nice to. Trending threads, trending words. How you guys using Twitter or threads at all? I've been using it. It did make my home screen. Okay. Mainly because it's the new thing. So I'm just like trying it out and seeing seeing what it's about. But I do like it because a couple of months ago I went through and like really curated who I was following on Instagram. So my Instagram for the past couple months I've actually been having like a decent experience which is crazy. It's good to know that. That's so loud. There's actually like interesting people and creators and things that I like that I follow. Yeah. So when threads happened and it all just transferred over, it's been pretty interesting seeing those people now. I have like a decent, a different experience than Twitter which when it first came out and I like was first starting to follow people. It was all tech people. So like Twitter for me for the longest this whole time has just been exclusively tech people. And now all of my other interests are also on Twitter basically because of threads coming out. Yeah. Before you stop, did you see they mentioned threads is adopting activity, Pub? They're like today. They've been saying that they're going to do that. And they've been like doing their due diligence and going through it. But I'm curious to see when it actually happens. I hope they do because it would be awesome. Yeah. It would be really cool. But we'll see. All right. Ellis. I don't have threads. Nice. At all. No. Don't you have like a other one? Don't you have like some weird fake account on it? I have a Twitter. No, you can't make a weird fake account. Oh, it's just. Yeah. You know what I mean? So like I had Twitter and then everyone's like, oh, Ellis, you got to get T2. And then it's like, oh, Ellis, you got to get blue sky. And then everyone's like, oh, Ellis, you got to get, I was like enough. Threads is too late. I'm done. So, uh, yeah. Outside looking cool. So if you see Ellis on threads, that's not it's fake. That's good to know. That's, that's super huge to know. All right. Well, I think what we're going to do after the break is hype or not. There are no notes out of no idea how to work. I'm going to judge. Which I'm excited for. But before we get into that, we're going to do trivia and then a quick break. Okay. Question two. Do you guys want a tech trivia question or a nature question? Agriculture asking Marques and Andrew. And part of me wants to say tech because when I get the other one wrong, I'll be more embarrassed. So the audience. Let's do a nature question. Nature question. Is this a nature? Is this a specific? I'm still going to get it wrong because the national park question. Oh, is this just nature in general? Let's do that. Okay. So, how many grizzly bears are alive in the world? Jesus. How? How am I going to? Why can I tell you a really cool fact I learned this week? Sure. Does it have to be an hour? Can it be later? Is it really related? No, it's not grizzly, but it is wildlife. Right now. I mean, what is the biggest natural predator to moose? Humans. No. Like biggest. Largest. Size-wise. Largest? Orcas. Yes. Let's do good. Yeah. Moose man over here. What? They swim and they swim up in like the Arctic. Oh, they do. And orcas have been known to eat moose. That's the thing. I don't think it's very common, but it can. That's kind of crazy. All right. That's the best trivia thing I've heard. That's clear. Talk me out. Over the week. Good to know. Imagine being an orchid and being like, do something now that we call hyped or not hyped or over under or hypothetically speaking. There's a ton of names. That was the name. Yeah. Basically, what we're doing is me and Ellis are going to go back and forth and name things in technology, maybe not in technology, mostly in technology. You guys have to tell us whether that thing is overhyped, underhyped, and I'll give you each one perfectly hyped. Okay. So you can use your one perfectly hyped throughout this round. And just be like, okay, yeah, I think that's pretty good. And we have to use the perfectly hype in the scenario. We can't retroactively go back. Yes. Because you want to like kind of save the perfect. Yeah, you got to save it for when you really don't. It's more spicy if you have to use it with fair. Okay. Cool. Okay. So I'm going to start off with an easy one. Red cameras. That's not easy. Are they? Yeah. Like not easy. Because to two different communities, these two very different areas. Yeah. That's I want to get into that. Give me both. Okay. So among among normal people overhyped, agreed. Nobody should get one. Well, they're also overhyped because like so many people are just like, Mark has used a red camera. That's why everything looks amazing. Right. They don't have any talent. It's just the red camera. Right. And like red built their brand up in a way that made that easy. Like good job. Red. You have a strong brand. People see red cameras and go, Oh, wow. Nice camera. But in like the video making community, I think they're, I don't know if they're appropriately hyped or under hyped, but like, I think they're really good, especially for a one person. Oh, as a one person shooting manual focusing camera as far as that goes, I can't get better quality out of any other camera. Me personally. So it is trying to average them. I guess it's like slightly under hyped. I'm definitely not using my perfectly hyped on the first one. It is hard to say under hyped because like, you can pull a lot of incredible footage out of a lot of cameras. And like, it's really hard to be like, Oh, yeah, people aren't giving red enough credit because I think they're getting, I think they're getting their credit. Very obvious they're getting their credit. But like you said, not many people ever need to have one. It's especially in our job. The way we use them. Like we pull thumbnails as a still frame from a video. And it is a 33 megapixel full frame still. That's unreal. Let's forget that from video frames. But I think as an average, I have to say they're over hyped. I think I kind of have to say they are over hyped. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Overhyped consensus. Yeah. All right. That was Europe. This isn't as near and dear to my heart. Okay. Licensed dongles. Like if you want to use some software, you have to plug a dongle into your computer. And I actually have a comment I want to add on this because I feel like they're universally loathed. I've never used one, but I feel like I would hate that. Here's the way I feel it, right? I use a lot of expensive software in my day to day. And I have multiple computers. Right. And I don't want to have to buy that software twice. So as annoying as the dongle is, it does let me multiple computer my stuff, which is why I'm throwing underhiking. That's what it sounds like. I feel like I have this is a little bit different, but on our Netflix account, you're only allowed to download to two different devices. But I've switched my phones enough time that I'm pretty sure there's a phone that has downloaded stuff on it. That's not deactivated. And I cannot figure out. So I only can down. I have to, when I go between my computer and iPad and phone, I have to keep deleting them off of it because I can only do one. So if I just had a dongle that forced me to do it, I would always know where it is. Yeah. SoundCloud does that, but it's my phone. So I don't want a dongle. I don't want to plug in. Yeah. That's the problem. Yeah. Atephone is a pain in the neck. NFC dongle. That doesn't exist, but it's such a pain in a physical dongle, though, is a pain because you always have to bring it with you. And then if you have multiple softwares, now I'm going to look like the middle school janitor of like, keychain of software dongle is walking around. That was me in college. Yeah. I would say this, it would be nice if this expensive software could also just log into more of the one computer at once. So I'm going overhyped. Fair enough. That is the correct answer. Okay. Mine is Twitter like services. So Macedon. Oh, overhyped. Easy. They're all over what? Every single one including Twitter is overhyped right now. Well, yeah, the average would be overhyped. It literally has to be their marketing is to overhyped it. And everybody's. Yeah. Guys over, but they're only overhyped in our communities. Ask your fair true true true. Ask your cousins about Macedon. What do they think? Like, so then in that sense, it's like everything is overhyped except for threads, which is actually pulling out of the tech community and going to the normies out there. But I still think overhyped. Overall, I mean, the other thing is is like all the smaller ones is everyone wants to be like, I have a blue sky in fight. It's so incredible. I was there. I was through everyone. Yeah. Whatever. You just wouldn't know because you didn't get to try it. And that's overhyping. Threads did have a couple of days there where they would put a little badge on your profile for what user number you were. And the cloud that I had was I was like top 1000. And there are people who had like, I was number 13787, 266. And it was like, I had a little little piece of me that was like, yeah, I was I was one of their really people are selling the vanity number account. But they got 420. It's already gone already. It's already and now it's just it's just the threads logo. Just like we thought it would be. Oh, I didn't even notice that. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I guess that I think you have to turn it on though. I think it's off by default. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Either way, they'll turn that on by default very shortly. Yeah. I agree with you. I think they're they're overhyped. Overhyped. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Overhyped. Ellis. RGB lighting. Overhyped. Next. Overhyped. Yeah. I think even like even yeah, even the the crowd that likes it doesn't even really like it anymore. Do we consider these lights behind us RGB lights? They do everything. I believe these are RGB. I see. I think RGB was a mistake. It was fun. But even you look at like think of main gear custom computers, their big ones selling now are like the stealth versions that have like very like the lights are one color and it's only to really accent all the really cool water cooling and like parts. Exactly. So we've definitely gone from the RGB everything like burn your retinas into the like wow, this is a cool like. Supervisor. Beautiful. Even razor is kind of doing it. That $200 or $80 razor mouse no RGB. Beautiful. Mostly for weight saving. But there was a there was an era where a few again, we came a mechanical keyboard because they all had just like you'd plug it in and it would just be like blasting you with RGB light waves for some reason. It's a keyboard. I don't need this. We have an extra five one where it's not even just through the keys is literally the whole base place. Yeah. If you're open to flying to you. You want to see any of your letters. You're just going to see green red and pink lights all the time. Yeah, that was tough. I'm going over hyped. Okay. Tensor G2. Is it interesting on anyone hyping it? That's the question. Besides Google and David. Wow, this is a tough one. I mean, if you're going camping, you got to bring the tents, right? The G2 is better in the that is tough. It's not okay. I can evaluate how good it is, but I don't know how to evaluate how hyped it is. It's pretty good, but it's not that great. Like in the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, it's decently performant and okay battery life. And for some reason, the Pixel Fold, it's quite nicely performant and not good battery life at all. But is it hyped at all? That's kind of I don't know if you're looking at it. I think I'm going to throw it as underhyped because just it hasn't reached the level of us like considering it. Like when you talk about all Android phones, you're like, this has the latest Snapdragon and like Tensor is just such in this category by itself where iOS is as well, but they've had years of making that. So you're used to saying this is like the new A whatever chip and then Tensor is just we've only had two years of it, two years. Yeah. So like, I think it's underhyped, but it's I don't know. Is the, which kind of it's good? And Bionic is overhyped or underhyped. I think all phone chips are overhyped if I'm being honest. I think I could say that the A16 Bionic is underhyped. I could argue that. I was going to say all phone chips are underhyped because they're tiny little computers in your pockets that are doing these crazy things like processing on device, building a voice out of scratch from your own voice, just like weirdly capable. Yeah. And then I see like 10 Qualcomm videos out of why that are like the new Snapdragon video. And I'm like, this is overhyped. Nobody cares about definitely overhyped in those. I think just for law of averages, say, I'm going perfectly hyped. You're using your perfectly hyped here. I'm using because if I say overhyped, that implies that there is any hype at all about Tensor. And I don't think there's really any hype. And if I say underhyped, that would have to imply that Tensor is like better than expected in some way, but it's not. It enables a couple different things that are pretty cool. I mean, the speech to text is super fast and Google assistance good on device. And it does have now playing in the background. I guess that's under. Okay. I'm going to go underhyped. You talk me into it. I think now playing is pretty sweet. I'm going underhyped. Now playing just for that one feature. Yeah. Which only works on Tensor. It literally can't work on anything else. It works on Tensor G1 as well, though. Okay. But I'll stay track and could never. Let's go underhyped. Wait, that was only a G1 feature. G1 and Gen G2. I thought now playing has been on Pixel for a while. Yeah, it's both the Tensor chips. I thought it was pre-tensor, though. Really? I think I might like Pixel 4 had it. Yeah. Now let's just give me the thumbs up. Yeah. Never owned one. Sounds overhyped. So that's not a Tensor feature. I think it's been there for a bit. And it never works when you wanted to. I swear now it's going to say now playing. I think it's so cool. And every time I'm like, what song is this? And I tap my phone to see it. Nothing's there. Okay. So there is something to it. And I have a tiny rant about this. And it is complete speculation because I don't know how this feature works. But if you are sitting in a car and the radio is playing and the song, you know, you change the radio station, it pulls up in the middle. It will listen to the first five seconds of the song and instantly tell you what that song is. And that is amazing. And I think what then it happens is it knows at what part of the song it was in. And it doesn't start checking for a new song until it gets to the end of where it sits. That song would be. So if you were in a four minute song and you pull up in the middle of that song, you're not getting another now playing answer for two more minutes. And so if you're shuffling through radio and you get one ID and then you shuffle to the next radio station, you won't get it. If that's how it works, I want to talk to the manager. I think that's how I love the conspiracy aspect of this is like maybe that's how it works because that's totally something that I would believe would happen. And that's how I realized it. Yeah. And that kind of makes... I think now playing is awesome. I just realized I don't have it on my Zen phone. I've been using it for like a month. So apparently I didn't use it very much. It's good. It's good and ubers. All right. So are you are you into perfectly hyped then if the thing you saw was perfectly hyped. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So you use your perfectly hyped. It still has his. All right. Streaming TV sticks. Is there any I have at all about this? I think it's overhyped because they're pretty much useless at this point. Are they? They're mostly built in the TV, isn't it? Exactly. Well, we're saying I wouldn't consider that built into the TV. I would just not consider that a streaming TV stick anymore. But you can you can you're talking about like a Roku stick that you plug into it HDMI port at this point to turn a non smart TV into a smart TV. Right. It's fine. I mean, most new TVs have the Roku or YouTube or Netflix built in. Yeah. And so if you have an old TV, you plug in the stick and it works. Exactly. I use one for my garage TV that I'm not going to buy new TV for my garage because I really use it and the chances of it breaking out there are it's like a 10 year old TV that I just have a chrome cat in there. Yeah. Maybe I'm just like in a bubble here because my family is always super excited about all of the new sticks because they can like put the Cody on and all these crazy things and do they have an Nvidia shield. I know that's the thing everyone's like it's still like I'm not going to answer that. And I don't really show is is the shield one of the sticks are we counting the shield. People still use that I have friends that use that shield and they love it from all the stuff they've done. People love it. Yeah. That's I don't even know what it is. There's like a shield mod community. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I got to go over hyped them. I'm going to say over. I'm sorry guys. Sorry guys. Sorry guys. I'm sure there are people out there where they haven't bought a smart TV yet but you will soon and it will be useless. Yeah. Good thing it's only like 40 bucks usually. Next one. Widgets. Underhyped. Underhyped. Yeah. Like touchable widgets scrolling on the Apple Watch it's supposed to be coming. Widgets in general are so good and I've seen so many iPhone home screens since widgets have come out that don't have widgets and I'm like guys what are you doing you're missing out widgets are so useful. I think I'm going to use my hyped my correctly hyped one here. I do agree there are some that are incredible but there are way too many that are just so pointless and take up your entire screen and just turn into clutter. I don't get all the new widgets on Mac because you're always going to have windows open and that seems crazy. I think I don't really use widgets that much. I'd rather like have a nice clean home screen. I do think I do agree a bunch of them are great. Widgets on the Mac are pretty dumb. Yeah. I don't understand that but I think some on phones and iPads are like incredible so like by average their perfectly hyped yeah on on widgets for Mac at the moment that they were announced the WWDC massively over hyped. I'm just going to pull up like the optional widgets I can put on my phone right now but like I can't live without my calendar widget on the ASUS Launcher widget cool my authenticator widget actually that might be good. Yes see you're out of luck in the Twitter you just go home and book my code my bank of America widget because I want to send money through Zell in a widget on my phone that sounds reasonable. That's insane. That is insane. That is crazy right the Chipotle widget which just as to sign in to get rewards I definitely need a shortcut on my phone the Tesla widget constantly displays how much battery you have unless you lock and unlock that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I do not need the in-break in widget actually no I love with me see I would look at your widgets I love widgets there's so many good ones I can't I can't go under hyped for widgets because not enough people use widgets I have to go sorry I can't go over hyped I have to go under hyped. I'm just gonna add the reddit is fun widget just because it's still there even though it doesn't work at all. I think I'm just gonna keep what is the TikTok widget oh it'll just like launch you into the TikTok camera right away oh damn you gotta be TikToking a lot to do that okay cool I'm gonna stick with perfectly I don't use widgets well enough so I understand they're there but I can't call them over hyped okay overhyped or underhyped the brown lucid underhyped you like it it's awesome does it's two tone right yeah it is it's the oh no we saw that in California it's the loafers of it's rough it's the loafers I don't I don't think there's that much hype but I'm still going overhyped I think the lucid in general design is underhyped I think people hate on it too much and it does look I think it looks good and in some colors it looks really good it looks like a browning that color though it looks like a whale shark both sides look like a whale shark yeah yeah but so what do you guys go with over hyped over hyped the brown is probably over hyped because if one person likes it then it's over like yeah sorry to whoever is listening to this podcast I feel like the chances that somebody's listening to us in their brown lucid is actually reasonable one that I saw sorry yeah one time if you own a brown lucid just know I'm on your side no okay send us the picture of us playing on your infotainment system handheld gaming consoles over hyped over hyped yeah everyone's smartphone gaming hard disagree smartphone game I think they're actually underhyped right now I think the switch marotted into play and everyone really liked it for a while and now actually everyone's trying to do it and I still think the switch is just doing it the best and the switch is still the only thing I see people I went to the airport and there were I saw two different groups of people with a switch propped up on their suitcases playing Mario Kart on separate controllers yeah the switches I've done that before it's awesome every other one that's trying to be like a hardcore switch is just insanely small demographics the switch is just such a it's the like perfect storm it's like yeah reasonably fun short games you want to play a bunch of or what if your switch could be could run windows and be overclocked yeah and play call like half life three on your it's just not something I'm interested in I am going over hyped or we're gonna get a lot of heat gaugeman for that it's totally fine I agree though I don't need to play counter strike source on the airplane or yeah or just use your laptop or use on the airplane the Google pixel fold I would like to go under hyped it's my hot take is it's not a hot take but it's more durable than I expected first of all yeah and it's fine isn't that crazy I had sand in it weeks ago to be fair I thought it would be broken by now it's the same I went so for those who missed that when I was first testing it when it first came out I went to a three day long beach tournament and I accidentally took it with me the entire time I came back here I put I opened the hinge and and when I made that like a hinge opening movement I could hear sand grinding in the gears of the hinge and I thought this thing is gonna die within days of me getting back here it hasn't guess what I also did on the plane I spilled water on it okay there's a water bottle in the little thing next to my seat when I popped it open it was a metal water bottle for some reason and it like fell onto the phone and it cracked the bottle open and it just started pouring all over the phone and I picked it up and I was like well that's the end of this phone shook it out like unplugged from the charge it's fine it's totally fine that's actually really impressive it cracked the the metal bottle like a thin metal water bottle like what it sounds like the like the photos of like the old volvos when cars would crash into them and then the car would get destroyed because the Volvo is just like a rock that no troubles on on that thing yeah that's the cyber truck this is a cyber truck of phones there it is it's the cyber truck of phones under hyped for sure pixel folds under hyped it's it's expensive I didn't say it was underpriced relative to the time right now it's probably over hyped because it's the most recent folding phone and that is always the most over hyped thing but like no the the the mix magic two came out after oh sorry I guess yeah then I don't know so we're back to under hyped yeah under hyped sure yeah all right next one Hyundai's new design language spicy and you can't get me to say under hyped I love their new design language I don't know just Hyundai just well okay Hyundai and Kia because we said you say under hyped I love them yeah yes so I would wait so no yeah that would be I don't think people are giving I won't say over hyped yeah I I'm very likely to say under hyped I think they're under hyped I think some people are giving them credit I don't think but even like Claire all the time has been and this is even just their EV's some of their just regular cars their ice vehicles are putting out tell you ride they look good man they look great Claire is like wow I really like like I saw a Kia Stinger here and I thought damn that looks like a like a pretty sick kind of fire like I would never buy a Maserati but the Stinger looks like one that I would buy they're both South Korean right I believe so yeah yeah did you guys see the Santa Fe that's 20 24 hours this morning when I was looking yeah we're brand and I in the car concluded it looks like a Range Rover but kind of like there's a very long conversation here about it yeah we had a huge thing I think Alex thought it looks a lot like Darwin's but I think it's more Range Rover style it is a through is a three row right there's no way it's that bulky with only two rows I think it's I think it looks for a three row SUV I think it looks fine I think it looks really good so wait Andrew you're saying I think it's under hyped I do think people are giving a credit I don't think I also think people are giving them credit they look really good and I think they still have the like cheaper brand just behind them but that doesn't mean it's that like it look they look great but also like the car itself is like me so that's good design because the design is so much better than the rest of the car that you are let down by the car which means the design is great that's true but I also think people are under appreciating how much of a moment in time this can be for some manufacturers as they make their first EVs they can kind of turn the corner into being uh into changing their reputation and I think they're doing it at the perfect time they're going to a new high school and they can reinvent themselves exactly yeah people call me Charlie or whatever else name you're gonna make up I don't know why it was at the Santa Fe that's what we're looking at I don't think it's an EV it's just a Santa Fe yeah oh yeah yeah I like tailpipes and stuff it's funny because I'm looking at the Santa Fe out right now and it does not look like it has a third row so maybe this does not but there's not enough pictures I think in here yeah the regular Santa Fe right now does not have a third row yeah I don't know if the new one is the one only has two rows I take it all back it looks like it like it has it has to have three rows also in terms of cars being like man and the design looking good like didn't Doug Demoros say recently that like Prius pretty much every car you buy is going to be fine and at a certain point just by the one that you is that still true with EVs though I feel like it's not truth yeah yeah I would bring it cars yeah true of all the mature regular cars gas cars and hybrids yeah yeah I don't know there's nothing in here confirming that it's three rows so it might only be two but this does look like it has more trunk space than the current Santa Fe Mariah describes the new Santa Fe as quote having a badonc it does is why I think it has to have three rows because if it only has two rows that thing's got a trunk on it but this one's not as bad because some of them straight up look like they have like a saggy diaper like the EV6 I think looks like it has a saggy diaper the lucid the lucid kind of has a saggy diaper yeah just like too much wait EV6 bottom you have the saggy because only because it's got that weird plastic piece that like like is like the corner of it the plastic piece that looks like a saggy diaper okay yeah but yep bro yeah look come on I like the EV6 that's fully loaded baby that piece I don't think it looks as saggy diaper there's just like too much behind the wheel back here you've seen like the porches though that all have that like rear because they're literally rear engine cars and they have all the over the rear axle past the rear axle past behind a rear axle and that like also comes with the look of being like a I don't know if it's saggy but it has the same like rear bias I think it used to be like more high hatchback either like have the whole rounded like the tight diaper filling yeah I don't know these don't these don't quite do it the which is a good thing I also think the the porches since they're using straight sixes a lot of the time it's like they they shape the car around the and they used to be air cooled to that's what I'm saying yeah yeah anyway sorry under hyped under hyped design under hyped design I do like them I still like the key EV6 but yeah I love that all right one more one more are you ready over hyped under hyped yep apple one I don't know what that is it's the sort of it's all solidated so go one same idea it's like instead of the planets instead of buying google storage just in drive you get like storage in photos drive Gmail everything it's like your cloud storage like your one google one account it seems like it's just storage and a VPN I have Google so apple one is cloud storage tv plus music and arcade oh and premiere also adds fitness and news plus and music to not say music I'm if I didn't say music you know if I didn't I read it off a list and severely screwed up so apple one it's just the whole shebang it's in all baby it's the whole enchilada it seems like google one is I'm gonna say under hyped just because I had no idea what I'm also just like not in that ecosystem at all I think this is good I think I generally think streaming services are like people don't realize how much value they're getting out of them and I generally think they're mostly underhyped like youtube premium being 12 bucks a month or whatever it is and getting ad free access to the entire like history of humanities video archive is pretty good I think that sentiment is right and will be wrong in five years because so many streaming services are just taking full advantage and it's all going to turn into this very weird too many of them asking for too much didn't Netflix just eliminate their 999 basic deal yeah so now rather than a basic no ad one device it's only ad supported or the like $15 multi-device 4k streaming version so you get for for $15 a month I think you get up to two devices or like two or three devices you do get 4k and no ads or you pay $699 and you get ads and then you get all of the shows that Netflix has ever made in its history yeah well and I ever hosted ever all the ones Netflix made but like the ones that Netflix didn't make who knows how long they'll be on there and you're in the middle of watching something and then they just go away and even even because it's new streaming service pops up like peacock and takes all the office episodes off of it right yeah I guess I don't know how much of a I don't really watch that much stuff that's not on YouTube but I guess with the ones that I do use they are super super worth it yeah like Spotify as a free me of them like Spotify is great whatever I pay for it might be $12 bucks $15 a month unlimited I tried to I was on a demo device just a second ago playing with something and I opened up the free version of Spotify and tried to play a song and I got a video ad I got a video ad to listen to a song that's crazy so paying for Spotify which I'm totally down for and getting unlimited access to music period is pretty sick I know people don't like paying monthly for things but I think Spotify is like the easiest one it's pretty it's just really hard to not from the user's side maybe use Apple music but just like yeah if you use Spotify you don't pay for a monthly do I pay monthly okay you were making that face like don't look at because I use the the free version for a long time because I just didn't care I would just like let it play and then oh and add whatever and then when I started like commuting and I was only listening to music but it's not it was a problem oh and add whatever it's like my music ends playing yeah but if I'm like boy Spotify bring it right now also don't you you don't get to choose a song in free Spotify um yeah I think you can only pick like albums and playlists yeah that's how I listen to music anymore I just albums but it would be like if I'm like doing my room when all reason it's like I want to listen to like when a new album comes out it's just like you can't listen in order doesn't like oh no by the time ram came out I was already listening I was already paying for it but there's albums like do you know girl talk like their entire album is essentially one song yeah just listening to that out of order sounds yeah or even like the incredible true story it has like a plot one you have to listen in order if you're especially the first time you listen to it you got a you need spot I'd pay ten bucks a month to listen to that album in order that's it do you guys remember iTunes match I've heard of that I iTunes match was the so it was released at the alongside Apple music and they said I had it I was the biggest iTunes matchers of all time where they said it was so complicated it began it was $20 a year and if you had a huge iTunes library which I did I had like a four five hundred gigabyte iTunes library they would take all of your iTunes library replace the files that were in Apple music with like the mastered for Apple ones and then upload all of that to the Apple music servers so you could open the Apple music app and stream your iTunes library from anywhere you were so I didn't pay for Apple music for years but I was using essentially Apple music and and still buying albums yeah damn yeah but now it's gone yeah I think I'm I think we're just landing on underhyped yeah that's what's happening dope good place to end this yeah all right we should get to the trivia we have some trivia questions yeah get those whiteboards all right I wrote down the first one already I'm not gonna change it so I was googling through the internet and I found out you could wake up a computer with nothing but an internet connection and the name for this whole thing was so funny that I I just had to turn it into a trivia question so I don't know why I know this the options are a want that stands for wake on magic packet to clomp like a horse cash load on message packet three stomp that stands for sleep time over mr. pewter and for alarm which is an automated local access revive message nothing I'm ready we're both ready yeah we're both ready three two one oh man we just put different things mark has womp it is womp wake on magic packet bummed no one shows sleep time over mr. pewter but clomp is a really I was like you're not gonna think about clomp there's no way you made that up I've seen I've seen don't know where I've seen this well what's the name of that that Mario character it's like the well there's chain chomp but there's also isn't the large stone one called like a womp it's basically this like flat one with feet and it goes like yeah and like smashes on top of you if he has feet he's womp but if he's floating he's a thwomp okay nice wow that wasn't something new every day yeah I forgot yeah the floating ones like on rainbow road and Mario car and the other ones are in like like Mario 64 and just run around in circles and just trying body slam you how many wolves are there is that the question oh question number two mark has already thinking about it how many grizzly bears are there in the world like what is the grizzly bear population the entire world the entire world and and we need the answer in in kilograms how many kilograms pound zone man yeah I'm gonna be in order of magnitude isn't yeah is this exact number or is this like going over closest without going over okay grizzly grizzly I'm gonna answer and then have a question same oh I'm nervous about my order of magnitude oh okay same order okay I said 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 mm-hmm all right Austin yeah I wrote 10 000 I guess that maybe we don't know closest until David answers which I will be answering what the actual number now the actual number is 55 000 wow oh wow okay so Mark has is closer yeah Mark has will get the point if grizzly bear or brown bear grizzly bear according to world population reviewed okay well ask David what he thinks the answers are both for the acronym for waking up computer be that is be want that is correct to want wake up on a magic packet is the correct answer and for how many grizzly bears are on planet earth 40 000 40 000 is incorrect but it is closest without going over for that question meaning you have taken the point away from Mark has an answer there are approximately 55 000 grizzly bears in the world David that gives you one point meaning you are tied with Mark has no I have two points because I have well got the first question right oh my gosh you have two points meaning you're in first place week one season three trivia how does it feel feels just like every other week we'll leave it at that thanks for listening thanks for watching don't see

And what still needs work? This week on Intuit, Vultures Pop Culture Podcast. It's some of the most expensive meat in the world. But is it even meat? This summer, for the first time, Americans are going to be able to try actual chicken meat that didn't involve killing a chicken. This episode of Gastropod, we are among the very first people to taste our way through these brand new lab-grown offerings. Chicken, hamburger, bacon, salmon, bluefin tuna, we tasted it all. We wanted to know whether it matches up to the real thing, but we also wanted to know if it can ever really replace meat from animals. Not to mention, keep our planet from going up in smoke. Find Gastropod wherever you get your podcasts and taste the future. What is going on, people of the internet. Welcome back to another very special episode of the Waveform Podcast. We're your hosts, I'm Mark Hezz. I'm Andrew. And I'm David. And forget everything you just heard. Because we're not actually hosting this one per se today. This is our official trivia finale. Season finale extravaganza, something like that is what you want to call it. But I thought it would be fun. We all like it. And the back of our heads, thinking it would be fun to do a trivia episode. To sort of wrap up a season of trivia, score a lot of points, learn a lot of things, and have a lot of fun. And that is what our hosts for the day have arranged for us. If you are listening to audio only, you're missing out on a really interesting first shot over there. With the mustaches, but I'll leave it to our hosts to take it away. All right, are you guys ready? Did you study the one cheaters I sent you last night? I did. I'll go. I said PDF. All right, thanks for not making the fuck ex. You did that. You didn't send me a one cheater. What? What was in Notion? Yeah, it was in Notion. Did you know I didn't get a notification? David, I sent it last night and I said study this. It knows you're not going to be good for you. That's not going to be real. There was some crazy hints in there. Really? Yeah. No fuck. I didn't get a notification on Notion. Nobody thought they brought this out. We're messing with you. Yes, getting out of the bottom. All right, and with that, you guys are really good. Did you play in that? Yeah. Wow. He's sad. All right, welcome to the Waveform Survey game. So for those of you that are not familiar with how this works, we're just going to go over it real quick. All right, so we put out a survey to our lovely fans and about 3,000 of them got back to us. Yes, that's awesome. It was incredible. So what we're going to do is we are going to ask you the very same questions that we asked our audience and you have to guess how they answered our survey. Okay. So important to note, I won't be able to give you any extra context to the questions I ask. What I ask you is exactly what I asked our fans. So you have to think like the MKBHD audience. So here's how the game's going to flow, right? I'm going to pose a question. All three of you have buzzers in front of you. Sure do. The first person to buzz in gets the first crack at the question. Okay. After you answer whether or not you get it right or wrong, it's going to go to the person on your left until we've cleared the board and we go on to the next question, new buzz and round. Makes sense? Does the whole question have to be finished before we... It does not, but if you buzz before I finish it, I'm not finishing it. Here's the other thing. After you buzz in, a five second countdown will begin. If you are unable to answer in those five seconds... It moves on. Sure. Yeah. I actually hadn't really thought about what it would have to do. Does it go clockwise? You just lose your answer for that question. It goes to the left. After Mark Hez's David, after David is Andrew. Clockwise. The top answer is going to be worth 10 points. The second best is 9, 8, so on and so forth. You want to get that big 10 jam up there. You know what I'm saying? Sure. How are we feeling guys? We're feeling good? I'm pretty nervous. I'm very excited. My heart's beating kind of quick. I've been thinking like the MKVHD audience for a long time. I feel like I should be pretty good. All right. To quickly update everyone on the score, David is currently in the lead with 24. Andrew and Mark Hez tied it 20. This is basically just my handicap. Exactly. Anything for that point we could get 10. Anything we could have. So this has prepared quite a show. All right. Who knows what the score will be by the end of this? I want to say 82 points. I'm nervous. Real quick before we get started. We have a new face behind us. Alex, our assistant to the studio manager here, has been helping us prepare this show for about two weeks now. And he's also going to be our official scorer. Good call. Good game. Nice. Because there's a lot happening. No need to pay them off, right? Silence after that. Very interesting. All right. Without further ado, let's get into it. The first question of the game. Oh, gosh. I'm so nervous. Name a popular tech YouTuber known for their in-depth... Tom Scott. Tom Scott is not on the board. I am sorry to say. It's fast, though. That brings it to me. Mark has. I think they said, Mr. Who's the Boss? Mr. Who's the Boss is the fourth ranked answer. You were going to say. Giving Mark heads. But I know the count. First one on the board, baby. Okay. Store update. Davis. Just kidding. Linus Tech Tips. Linus Tech Tips is the second answer on the board, giving you a whopping nine points. I guess we're not going tech. We have eight answers left on the board. All right. Andrew, we asked over 3,000 MKBHD fans. Name a popular tech YouTuber known for their in-depth videos. Yeah. He's a sounds-cat. I was like, Tom. Paul's hardware. That's a good one. That's a good one. Oh, I guess it wasn't a good one. I like the answer. Paul, I support you. I love Paul. I think you're in depth. I'm going to try MKBHD. Oh, that is correct. That is the number one answer on the board. Over 800 MKBHD fans described you as in-depth. Okay. All right. Those are the comments I'm reading. That's good. I feel better now. All right. My turn. Yeah. Mr. Mobile. That's a good one. Mr. Mobile is the fifth highest answer on the board with over 100 MKBHD fans describing him as in-depth. Sixth highest on the board. Yes. Great at reading. We have five more answers. I have one for you. A lot. David and Mel. Are you giving up? No. A non-zero amount of people actually did put David and Mel for this question. I think like 10 or 11. It did not make the top 10 answers. But yes, David. I only have four YouTube videos, but I appreciate you guys. They are in depth. They are very in depth. That brings us back to... That's true. Mark has brownly. I think they said super staff. Sorry. Not on the board. Wow. Interesting. Gosh. David. I just need. Unfortunately, I just need to not make the final list of answers. Although, again, a non-zero amount of people put I just need. Who do I want? Andrew? I have another one, but he doesn't do any more Deeter bone. Well, that would be interesting. He doesn't have his own channel. He has his own channel, but he is still a techie. We got some Deeter bones, but not on here. Mark has. Out of spec reviews? Oh, I've got one. Oh, sorry. David. David 2D. David 2D is on there. He is the fifth highest dancer on the board with almost 150 people describing him as in depth. I'm throwing out in depth. I think they're just naming tech YouTubers. Well, this is our discovery. No, it's the Dave, but he's famously Terce. I'm going with Terce. What was that word? I would. Terce. I believe it's Andrew's turn. Name a tech YouTuber. Wow. Salt. I think that's what this... That's what I'm going with. Unboxed there. That's what I think is up there. What? That was the 11th highest answer, but it is not worth any points to Dave. Not very in depth either. Hardware connects. Another one, really? I think the discerning is still going through. I think we'll go one time through, then we can move on to the next question. Clear the board for you guys. So that brings us to Andrew. Austin Evans. Yeah, he's probably on there. Oh, the discord would say... You gotta be... Wow. Sorry. I like you bleeped me. Mark has you want to take one final guess? One final stab. Name a popular tech YouTuber known for their in-depth videos. Let's go, Michael Reeves. Oh, I've got one. I've got one. All right, David, I'll let you go one more. Snasyncue or... Snasyncue is the eighth highest answer on the board, giving David a three points. Quinn should probably be like the top of that. At number nine, with 78 votes, technology connections. Oh, wow. I made it on there. That dude is in there. That's a great point. And number 10, with 38 votes. He's not like the fifth. Flossy Carter. Flossy, who's four? Hourlong video. Number four is Mr. Who's the Boss? Oh, no, no. It's Jerry. Oh, Jerry, everything. Oh, my God. That's not... He was number seven. Oh, he definitely did. Not seven videos. Okay. I was four points. Oh, sorry. I was thinking reviews, but videos in general. David is currently in the lead with 47 points. Whoa. This is hot. Followed by Mark Hez with 37. Whoa. Followed by Andrew at 20. We know. Correct. 20 clothes. I'm sorry. There. Okay. David, Andrew, Mark Hez, we asked over 3000 MKBHD fans. What is the most annoying kind of person on Twitter? Mark Hez. Spambot replies. Spambot replies are... Wait, I thought they... Yeah, they are on there. No, they're not on there. They're there. Oh, yeah. There we go. Oh. David. Crypto people. Crypto people is, in fact, on there with over 59 votes. Three. Wow. Andrew. Andrew. Elon fans. Elon fans is the second highest answer on the board. No, where's I? No, it's the second highest. Oh, you pressed the wrong one then. Oh. And that's what I was thinking of saying. Elon Musk himself. I was going to say Tesla fanboys, but that's all right. Blue checks. Elon fans, Tesla fanboys. I roped them all into one category. But yes, ever since it was ruined, the number one answer for who is... What is the most annoying kind of person on Twitter with over 300 votes is Elon Musk himself. It's just that one person. The kind of person. All right, we have seven answers left on the board. No reason to stop here. What do we got going on? What is the most annoying kind of person on Twitter? David. Growth hack people. Sorry. No. People begging for giveaways. Giveaways. No. More pecs. People who use hashtags. Not yet. David. FinTech people. I guess that's crypto. All right. More pecs. People who post way too much. We did get a lot of those, but not on the board. Wow. What about money stock? That's the same as the... Not on our top answers, but... Well, Growth hack is like... Orc quest. Yeah. But it also says... Gary V. himself. How is it going to be? Actually, we did not show any of this. Wow. I know. Everyone's using their mute go... Incorrectly. Hustle, clout, share, people. Like, hustle porn. Sigma grinds it. Yeah. Yeah. We did get a lot of those, but again, not on our final answer. I need to rethink about this question. MkBHC. You see, get negative. No, but more than more than zero people put Ellis Roe. Photographers. I can't believe that. I love Ellis. Yeah. That's like... I'm surprised that's so low. So it's in between this. Yeah. Aren't you supposed to say it and we're all supposed to go like... Oh! Yeah, like say it out loud. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that. Number eight. Our fan said... Everyone. Oh wow. Really? Yep. A hundred and eighty-nine people. Everyone. Maybe those people just don't like Twitter. Yeah. Number seven, with 161 votes, were political accounts. We should have done that. Oh. Number six, stand accounts. Oh god. With 130 votes. That should be number one. Number seven, on our board, were trolls. A lot of people, but not like trolls. We should have said that. I got a skate blue tooth. Number nine was conspiracy theorists or misinformation accounts. And number 10, with 54 votes were... I need to take a few years. ...know it all. Okay. Learn a little bit. ...all right. ...on to the next question. All right. If you were trapped on a desert island, which tech CEO would you least want to run into? David. Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg was the second highest answer. It was 713 votes. Mark has, what do you got? Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos is in fact, wait, no, he's not on there. What? I guess he's not the CEO anymore. I'm gonna say Elon. I was gonna say it has to be somewhere. Elon is the number one answer on the board. Elon, who was first? I was gonna say it on, but he could maybe help them make a boat. Take CEO. I ran out. Sorry, Mark has. David. Sooner or perhaps. Sooner or perhaps is in fact on there. 89 people. I feel like he's not gonna run into shoes. He's a direct guy. He's a amazing man. Oh, now I got to remember his name. These are just the top stats in the demo. Yeah. The stats in the demo is the eighth highest answer on the board. Oh, that's a good name. It just named a tech CEO. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Tim Cook. Kevin Mellon. I don't know. I'm in on our board. On my bed. What's going on? A hush fellow. David. David. Linda Yokorino. Unfortunately, did not make the list. Yeah, he loves not even the CEO anymore. Yeah. Actually, yeah. Is this CEO of Tesla? Yeah. That's true. Yeah, that's fair. He's a CEO. He's a CEO. You're like, he's not the Twitter CEO anymore. I mean, he's not a CEO. No, he's got this other company. I think it was really telling that, you know, we asked 3,000 people this question and 1,600 of them put either Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. That's because there's a two. Yeah. Zach's not even that annoying. Gorkas. Evan Spiegel. Oh, that's pretty good. No, sorry, Mark has. What are the crap that I feel like? I feel like another tech company is I feel like we already got through. Who's the Samsung CEO? Samsung CEO is not on here mostly because there are three of them. He's also in jail for in bezel man. It seems like a pretty hard thing to do, you know, in bezel. I don't want to be on that guy's desert island. That's true. He's going to do that. I do have to say, all right, you're right. That's going to do it. Tim cooks amazing, but I don't need to hear good morning every time I'm stuck on a desk. No, yes. Wait, hold on. We got to correct something here. Jeff Bezos was in fact the fourth highest answer. So I think we should award Mark as six points. Six points. Seven points. Our bad, Mark has. I'll take them. There is one person missing from the list due to a calculation error that no one has guessed yet, but maybe David is about to guess it. Lisa Sue. Unfortunately. No? No. Wow. I think I'll tell you. More pees. Mark has. Carl Pay. Carl Pay isn't on here. Oh, wow. That's not the, oh, you want me here when you're near. It's called. Well, but it's, would you lease like to run into? So technically, maybe we're like, well, I'd love to hang out with Carl. That's why I wouldn't. No. No, these are just all the text that you. Yeah. That people know. I've given up. I haven't understood a CEO. Do you guys have said in a while? Pete Lau. Yes, that he's the current CEO of OnePlus instead of the old one. Wow. All right. Shall we clear out the board? I'm not sure. That is all good. All right. The sick highest answer on the board was any CEO at all. Literally, I don't want to see anyone. I can be an answer. Okay. The fifth highest answer on the board was Reddit CEO Steve. Oh, man. No, that's so good. No, I'd love to see him on an island. Throw him into the water. And this one I thought was really funny. I'm just kidding. In Minecraft. 40, what number is that? 45 people put Steve Jobs with most of them adding. If I'm seeing him, it means I'm already dead. Wow. That's that's that got dark. Yeah, that's okay. It's a fair reason. There was one accounting error on our part. I just like to declare that was 99 people saying Bill Gates as the tax CEO. He is not currently a CEO that I'm aware of. No, but foundation. Yeah, his foundation. That is a good point. People just responding. So yeah, I guess we have to think we have to think like them. Yeah. Yeah. So Elon is the top answer every time. And with that, let's move on to our next category. Yep. Mark has Andrew David. We asked over 3000 MKBHD fans. Name an app. Everyone hates. Mark has Twitter. Twitter is the number one answer on the board with 765. Mark has again. Instagram. Instagram is the third highest number on there. Andrew. Ready. Ready to is the highest answer on the board. David, wow, this is going fast. Snapchat. Oh, did not. Oh, geez. I don't even have it. So I guess I love it without a Facebook. Facebook is the second highest answer on the board. I have not had that for like 15 years. I'm living without it right now. Your parents though. No, you're right. This is like messing. Yeah, no, I hate Facebook. But I'm on a Discord. Also, remember, a large part of our audience lives outside. Mark has. What's app? What's app is on there? Kind of gave that one to you.

I have a power company. I like cable. Sorry. It's awful. I hate it. Mastodon's not on there. What? I'm saying massive. You just f**k.

No. Baby. All of them because I don't want to smartphone. No, that's a good guess. But unfortunately, we have a phone app. Oh my gosh. The phone app is the 11th highest thing again. 76 people. Mark has messages. Another one. I message with on the not on the board, but 51 responses with messages. Wow. Nobody hates. I don't know. What's apps on there? Email. Gmail. I'll give it to you with Gmail. It's on there. I think that. Yeah. That's a good one actually. Stock apps. Stock apps. You didn't put it up there. Apple Mail. No money. Nobody. Nobody. Some people I know usually. I love to discuss. 39 people are quite immediately. They're default email clients. Jesus. Lord, you don't have to use it. You can use other stuff. A lot of people don't know. I don't know. I can't do it like work, chat, so, like, teams are slack. The 10th highest answer on the board was Microsoft Office. I'm going to give that to you just because team's soft. So bad. Because team's not part of office, team's as part of office, but it's not. Then I'm giving it to Andrew. No. It's not part of it. Yeah, but I get where you're going for. Like your work and your work. Yeah, look this up. I would give this to. No, I'd give it to Andrea. All right. I'm giving it to Andrea. I'm going to ask you.

At number eight with 102 votes We have the alarm app Fair one likes waiting up. That's even number one. I think the alarm apps are usually pretty good on most fun No, they're annoying though that I hate it, but I have to use it. I mean I guess and at number five We're with a hundred and sixty seven Wow Most people love TikTok. No, I hate it, but they can't live without eating how much I love how much they use it I don't have it so whatever Wow I can't believe we didn't say I can't believe we did a song. Wow.

I have seen the last. Oh, that's true. Yeah, a future you would not buy the phone without that means I don't know if you knew this. There's a lot of truth and Wi-Fi are not the same thing I mean David there's a couple of things on there that are god All right, whatever. Oh, whatever. Cellular service is a dumb thing, but I guessed it. So I guess I'll take it. It's a feature. All right So we're about to wrap up the game. Yeah, but first We're going to enter what I call uh-oh the rapid round. Oh shoot because this isn't rapid Here's how this is going to worry. There's going to be a 25 second timer. You're going to hear our normal trivia guessing music Each one of you one at a time Is going to have 25 seconds to give one answer for five questions So I'm going to go question answer question answer question answer That I'm going to ask the next one of you five different questions five same questions So you're trying to get higher answers on the board. Okay, everyone else and just to shake things up Double points are you allowed to repeat someone else's answer when you go to them? Okay, exactly first is like kind of good Going forced is important, which is why we're going to give it to Andrew who currently has 142 and 42 points andres in third place right and then me all right. Yes, then David Then work as again, these are double points. I'm sorry These are double points. That was me apologizing to our scorer Alex. We'll just take the normal points and then double them Big brain yeah You know David when you're right you're right All right, so you will not need your buttons for this round all right, please do not hit your buttons for this round I like to have some physically moved away from us to not hit All right, okay Andrew how you feeling? Horrible if you'd like to skip a question say pass and we'll get to you come back. Yeah, we'll come back to it at the end So 25 seconds five questions 25 seconds five questions. Are you ready? Do I still this? Name an operating system you cannot trust windows name a college that good programmers graduate from Stanford name a product that never works printers name a tech product that spends almost all of its time in your car This Pass what is the worst password someone could choose password name a tech product? Oh, and that's time Excellent job Andrew four out of five questions. Okay. All right David. How do you feel? Are you ready for our rapid round? I forgot All right four of the questions here. We go all right If you guess something that Andrew has already guessed I will buzz Okay, you will be able to answer that question again If you choose not to answer it you could say pass and we will double back okay ready yep Name an operating system you can't trust Linux name a college that good programmers graduate from Berkeley name a product that never works Uh Blit you that phones name a tech product that spends almost all its time in your car um Pass what is the worst password someone could choose hunter two good one What Marquez I got screwed on that I was actually sad that I didn't say that because I thought it was so funny But you know It's a really old maim's the tiny password. No, it's a warcraft thing. I thought it was wait. Is that what runscape runscape? I thought it was runscape. Yeah. Is that what that is? Yeah, yeah, it's a runescape meme dog. It's like Oh look runescape has like a An anti-password thing so you can't get hacked look I'm typing my password and they just type star star star star star and then right under it the person's like hunter two And then it's like he gets hacked and Jesus yeah, all right, Marquez said windows you sit Linux. I'm not saying I'm not saying anything Mac are you ready work as I'm ready Mac how are you feeling? I Having the third it's tough going third, but I'll be okay. You get more context at least yeah I think second is a good and you have more time to think a lot because there's a couple questions that I Just it's still I'm forgetting my answers as you talk. So this is perfect. It's good. Yeah, because whenever you're ready. I'll do I'm ready. All right Man operating Okay, name a college that good programmers graduate from Caltech name a product that never works Siri name a tech product that spends almost all its time in your car car charger and finally What is the worst password someone could choose one two three four no no all zeroes all zeroes All zeroes all right. I would have said one two three four five. I think that's good one birthday The car one would totally blank down that one. Yeah, I was I wanted to say phone like 10 times It's still a tech product. Yeah, it's all weird though because it's part of your car. I know So it feels like not a tech product just the car Geek like GPS, but nobody uses those dedicated GPS like somewhere. I should have just said phone My phone is in my car a lot. Yeah, but it's with you more. Yeah Spends all of its time in your cars. Is that what the question? Yeah, it's almost all of its time in your car I think both you and I didn't even say car chargers get I did I passed did you I passed and tried to come back and was just gonna say I didn't hit it. Oh, sorry. I was They think you were sparing it. Sorry. I have a bad feeling mark as you When you this isn't on the bottom guessing, but you were like one two three no no no zeroes and Alex will like Makes me think your first one is better than you said One two three four five is better than zero zero zero zero zero or Maybe the question is for like four numbers and maybe they'll give it to you But just know that's where like just I mean one two three four is the obvious one, but I feel like more people Have actively had all zeros I don't know. Yeah, it's like a famous one. So you know, I don't know what else it just said you said password That's a good one password that's a password and one you said hunter two She's like kind of a meme one who have some points for it. Yeah, I can't leave any other I think one two three or five is really good Is there any other card one is that is where do you stop because like you say for current? Nothing we both skipped I passed and then was just gonna say phone because I couldn't think phone charger is a really good one Because there's literally nowhere else that would go. Yeah, but everyone just uses regular USB-C cables now instead of a separate phone charger Because cars have actual although most people have new cars. So I guess that's true. All right We've calculated our scores You guys did really really well in in fast one in that round right? So should we should we break down everyone's thing? All right, David we asked you What's an operating system you can't trust you said Linux that was the second highest answer on our board We asked you what's a program?
